Explanation:

The query is using the `bool` query type with a `filter` clause to filter for patients who have a `VAERS_ID` of ""GLAXOSMITHKLINE BIOLOGICALS"". The `filter` clause uses a `term` query to match the `VAERS_ID` field with the given"

Explanation:

The above query will return all the patients who have a `VAERS_ID` field with the value ""UNKNOWN"". This is because the `VAERS_ID` field is used to identify the manufacturer of the vaccine, and an unknown manufacturer will be represented by the string ""UNKNOWN"".

Explanation:

The given prompt is looking for all the cases where the vaccine recipients got vaccinated in 042bela. To achieve this, we can use a bool filter query in Elasticsearch. The query consists of two filters:

Explanation:
The above query uses the `match` clause to filter the search results based on the `AGE_YRS` field. The `value` parameter specifies the value to match, and the `operator` parameter specifies the comparison operator to use. In this case, we're using the `=` operator to match exactly 92.0 years.

The above query uses the `bool` query type with a `filter` clause that contains two `term` filters. The first filter looks for documents where the `STATE` field is equal to ""RA"", and the second filter looks for documents where the `STATE` field is equal to ""AR"".

Explanation:
The above query uses the bool filter to filter out the records based on the state of the patient. The term filter is used to search for the values ""LL"" and ""LG"" in the ""STATE"" field. This will return all the records where the value of the ""STATE"" field is either ""LL"" or ""LG"".

Explanation:

The above query uses the `term` query to search for documents where the value of the `AGE_YRS` field is equal to 0.58 years. The `size` parameter is set to 0, which means that only the count of matching documents will be returned, and not the actual documents themselves.

Explanation:

The provided question is asking to search for vaccine recipients who had YELLOW FEVER (STAMARIL) shot. To answer this question, we need to construct an Elasticsearch query that will retrieve all the relevant documents from the index.

Here's the query we will use:

```
{
    ""query"": {
        ""bool"": {
            ""filter"": [

}
```
Explanation:

* `RECVDATE.keyword`: This refers to the `RECVDATE` field in the Elasticsearch index, which contains the date the vaccine was received. By using the `keyword` type instead of the `date` type, we can perform a keyword search on the field, allowing us to search for exact matches.

Explanation:

The above query will retrieve all the documents from the index where the value of the ""AGE_YRS"" field is exactly 21. The ""size"" parameter is set to 0, which means that only the count of matching documents will be returned, and not the actual documents.

To get the number of patients who are 21 years old, we can use the ""term"" query with the ""AGE_YRS"" field name. The ""term"" query will return only the documents where the specified field has the exact value specified in the query. In this case, we are looking for documents where the ""AGE_YRS"" field has a value of 21"

Explanation:
The above query uses the ""bool"" query type to specify a set of ""must"" clauses that must be true for a document to be considered a match.

The first clause is a term filter on the ""STATE"" field, matching only documents where the value is ""INFLUENZA"".

The second clause is a term filter"

This query will return all patients where the value in the ""AGE_YRS"" field is equal to 107.

Explanation:
The given question asks for all patients whose cage months is 0.3. To achieve this, we need to filter the search results based on the'recvdate' field and the'state' field. The'recvdate' field should have a value greater than or equal to now minus 30 days (to filter out the recent records). Additionally, we should only consider the patients who have an active state.

To accomplish this, we can use the '"

Explanation:
The given query is searching for all patients who have been vaccinated and have reported a therapy change in their clinical notes.

Here's how the query works:

1. The outermost layer is a `bool` query, which specifies that we want to search for documents that match at least one of the filters inside the `filter` array.
2. The first filter is a `term` query, which searches for documents where the `"

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Explanation:

The above query uses the `bool` query type to specify a filter and a must clause. The filter clause uses the `term` query to match records where the `RECVDATE` field is equal to ""2022-03-31"". The must clause uses the `match` query to match records where the `STATE` field is equal to ""CA"".

The query also includes the `ALLERGIES` field in"

      }

Explanation:

The given clinical notes are searched for patients who have reported retroperitoneal neoplasm as a symptom after vaccination. The search query uses the Elasticsearch `bool` query and `must` clause to filter the results based on the `"

Explanation:

The query above uses the `bool` query and specifies two filters to narrow down the search results. The first filter is a `term` filter that matches only documents where the `STATE` field is equal to ""normal"". The second filter is a `match` filter that searches for the phrase ""psychiatric evaluation normal"" in the `SYMPTOM_TEXT` field.

By combining these two filters, we can find all the patients who have a ""normal"" state and also"

The above query uses the bool query to filter out the patients who have ""Ankle fracture"" in their clinical notes. The filter clause has two filters, one using the term filter to match the value ""Ankle fracture"" in the ""STATE"" field, and the other using the exists filter to check if the ""RECVDATE"" field exists or not.

Explanation: The query retrieves all records from the elasticsearch index where the value of the HOSPDAYS field is exactly equal to 45.0. This will return all records where the vaccine recipient was hospitalized for exactly 45 days.

Note: In this answer, we are assuming that the field names in the elasticsearch index match the field names provided in the prompt. If there are any differences in the field names, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly."

```
{
""query"": {
""bool"": {

Explanation:

The above query uses the `bool` query and filters the search results based on the `HOSPDAYS` field. The `term` filter matches only records where the value of `HOSPDAYS` is exactly 23.

Note: In the question, it is mentioned that the vaccine recipient was hospitalized for 23.0 days, so we are searching for records where the value of `HOSPDAYS` is exactly 23, not just greater than or equal to 23."

```
Explanation:
The above query is searching for documents in the index where the `HOSPDAYS` field has a value of 17.0. The `size` parameter is set to 0, which means that only the count of matching documents will be returned, and not the actual documents themselves. The `term` query is used to search for exact matches on a single field. In this case, we are searching for documents where the `HOSPDAYS` field has a value of exactly 17.0.

Note that the field names in the query match the field names in the provided list, so you may"
3027,"To find out how many patients were hospitalized for exactly 45 days, we can use the range filter in Elasticsearch to filter out all records where the value of ""HOSPDAYS"" is exactly 45. Here's the query:

This will return only those records where the value of ""HOSPDAYS"" falls within the range of 45.0 days (inclusive).

Explanation:
The above query retrieves all the documents (i.e., patient records) from the Elasticsearch index where the ""HOSPDAYS"" field has a value of exactly 42.0. The ""size"" parameter is set to 1, which means that only one document will be returned.

In this case, we are looking for the number of patients who were hospitalized for exactly 42 days. The query uses the ""term"" clause to search for documents where the ""HOSPDAYS"" field has a value of exactly 42.0. The ""size"" parameter ensures that only one document is returned."

Explanation:
The above query will retrieve all the documents from the index where the value of the ""HOSPDAYS"" field is equal to ""1.0"". The ""size"" parameter specifies that we want to retrieve only 10 documents.

The query uses the ""term"" query type, which matches documents based on a specific term in a field. In this case, we are looking for documents where the value of the ""HOSPDAYS"" field is exactly ""1.0""."
3037,"To answer this question using Elasticsearch, we can use a range query to filter the records based on the value of the ""HOSPDAYS"" field and then use the ""stats"" aggregation to calculate the count of records that have a value greater than or equal to 114.0. Here's the Elasticsearch query:

Explanation:

The given clinical notes ask for all patients who received vaccines on 01/13/2022. To answer this query, we need to filter the search results based on the `RECVDATE` field and the `VAERS_ID` field.

The `bool` query allows us to use multiple filters in a single query. The `filter` clause specifies that we want to filter based on the `RECVDATE` field, and"

Explanation:
The above query uses the `bool` query and specifies two filters:

1. The first filter uses the `range` query to retrieve all records where the `recvdate` field is greater than or equal to March 30, 2020. This ensures that only records from March 30, 2020, or later are returned."

}
}
}

Explanation:

The query is searching for patients who have a record in the VAERS database with a receipt date of September 28, 2021. The filter is using the term query to match only records where the RECVDATE field contains the value ""2021-09-28"". The match query is used to ensure that only records with a valid VAERS ID are returned. The exists keyword is used to check if the VAERS ID field is not null or empty.

Explanation:

The given query is looking for all patients who have an adverse event symptom onset date of December 16, 2021. Here's how the query works:

1. The outermost layer is a bool query, which means it requires at least one of the following conditions to be true for a"

      ""recvdate"": {
        ""gte"": ""2021-11-30""
      }
    }
  }
}
```


Explanation:

The query above uses the `range` query in Elasticsearch to filter the search results based on the `recvdate` field. The `gte` (greater than or equal to) operator is used to select only documents where the value of `recvdate` is greater than or equal to November 30, 2021. This will return all patients who have an onset date of adverse event symptoms on or after November 30, 2021.

Note that the `recvdate` field name may need to be adjusted based on the actual field name used in the database."

Explanation:

* The `range` query is used to search for documents that contain a specific range of values in a field. In this case, we are searching for documents where the `recvdate` field is greater than or equal to 06/08/2021.
* The `gte` (greater than or equal to) operator is used to specify that we want to find documents where the `recvdate` field is either equal to or after 06/08"

Explanation:
The above query uses the query string API in Elasticsearch to search for records where the `RECVDATE` field is equal to '01/05/2022' and the `STATE` field is equal to 'Submitted'. This will return all the records that have a submission date of 01/05/2022 and have a state of submitted.

Explanation:
The query uses the `bool` query and sets up a filter using the `range` filter. The `range` filter specifies that we only want to return documents where the `recvdate` field is greater than or equal to October 16, 2021.

The `bool` query also allows us to specify multiple filters, so if we wanted to filter by other fields as well (e.g., `state`, `age_yrs`, etc.), we could add additional filters to the `bool` query."

Explanation:

The given clinical notes query is looking for all patients whose adverse event symptoms started on or after 01/21/2022. To achieve this, we can use a range filter in the Elasticsearch query to filter the records based on the `recvdate` field. The `range` filter will only return records where the `recvdate` field is greater than or equal to 01/21/2022.

The first `must` clause filters for documents where the value of the `STATE` field is ""VA"". The second `must` clause uses the `match` query operator to search for the phrase ""cardiac catheterization test"" in the `CLINIC"

Explanation:

The given clinical notes request all patients whose information is received on 01/28/2022. To achieve this, we need to filter the records based on the `RECVDATE` field and ensure that the value is greater than or equal to 01/28/2022.

The above query is written in Elasticsearch query language and it is used to search for patients who have been diagnosed with diabetes.

Here's a breakdown of the query:

* `bool`: This specifies that we want to perform a boolean search.
* `filter`: This specifies that we want to filter the results based on certain criteria.
* `term`: This specifies that we want to match documents where the value of the ""STATE"" field is exactly ""diagnosed"".

Explanation:
The above query uses the bool filter to find records that meet both conditions. The first condition is that the state is Virginia (VA), and the second condition is that the allergy field contains the word ""hives"". The term filter is used to search for exact matches of the word ""hives"" in the ALLERGIES field.

Additionally, we need to match the VAERS_ID field with a specific value, in this case, ""some_id"".

Explanation:
The given clinical notes ask for all patients who previously got vaccinated on 9/24/2021. To achieve this, we need to filter the search results based on the `VAERS_ID` and `RECVDATE` fields.

Explanation:

* The `term` query is used to search for exact matches of a specific date in the `RECVDATE` field.
* The `RECVDATE` field name is specified as the value for the `term` query.
* The date ""2022-01-26"" is enclosed in single quotes so that it is treated as a string and not as a date.

Explanation:

The above query uses the `bool` query to filter the records based on the `RECVDATE` field. The `filter` section of the `bool` query contains a single `term` filter that matches only the records where the `RECVDATE` field is equal to ""2021-07-14"".

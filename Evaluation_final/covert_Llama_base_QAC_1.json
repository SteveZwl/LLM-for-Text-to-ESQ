The code has three parts:\n\n   1) First, we need to identify the field names. We use `prompt.split(\" \")` to split the prompt into a list of strings.

This leaves us with a string that contains only the field name.

In this case, it would be easy to write a script that reads the clinical notes, searches for \"allergic to\", and then uses the word after \"to\" as the allergen. Then just search for \"meropenem\" in the list of allergens.\n\n###### But what if there were thousands of potential allergens, or millions of patient records? We could use the same approach, but we would have to come up with some way to identify which patients had which allergies. We could try to read through each patient's medical record looking for a specific pattern, but that would require a lot of work and wouldn't scale well. Instead, we could use machine learning to automatically learn which words are associated with which allergies, and then use that knowledge to make predictions about new patients.\n\n###### That's exactly what this","3444":"How many patients whose date of vaccination is 05\/10\/2021?\n```\n### Elasticsearch database with field names:\n# RECVDATE, STATE, AGE_YRS, VAERS_ID, SEX, SYMPTOM_TEXT, DIED, ER_VISIT, L_THREAT, HOSPITAL, HOSPDAYS, DISABLE, VAX_DATE, LAB_DATA, OTHER_MEDS, CUR_ILL, HISTORY, PRIOR_VAX, TODAYS_DATE, OFC_VISIT, VAX_TYPE, VAX_MANU, VAX_LOT, VAX_DOSE_SERIES, VAX_NAME, ALLERGIES\n\nWhat is the filed name?The filed name is [RECVDATE]\n\nWhat is the condition value","2405":"patients = es.search(index='covid-19', body={'query': {'bool': {'must': [{'match': {'STATE': 'TX'}}, {'range': {'RECVDATE': {'gte': '2022-04-25'}}}]}}})\nprint(len(patients['hits']['hits']))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n    18\n\n#### 3.4.2.

But instead of using regex, we are going to use the `find()` method. This method will find all the words in a string that matches a pattern. In our case, we are looking for the word \"vaccine\". So we are going to pass the regular expression `\"^vaccine\"` as an argument. You can also see that we have removed the square brackets around the regular expression.\n\n```python\ndef generate_elastic_query(text):\n    # Prompt: ### Elasticsearch database with field names:\n    # RECVDATE, STATE, AGE_YRS, VAERS_ID, SEX, SYMPTOM_TEXT, DIED, ER_","2223":"```json\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"term\": {\n                        \"vaers_id\": \"20217483\"\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"term\": {\n                        \"ofc_visit\": true\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"should\": [\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"clinical_notes\": \"which synovial biopsy is the most common symptom after vaccination\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 26.

However, it would be nice if we could also generate a search engine query based on an input question. This would enable us to create a general purpose conversational agent that can answer any type of question. We will now explore how to do this by building upon our previous work on generating database queries.\n\nIn this section, we will build upon our prior work on generating database queries. We will modify our code to automatically generate a search engine query given an input question.\n\nTo get started, you will need to download the [Elasticsearch-Search-Engine](https:\/\/github.com\/udacity\/CarND-Python","11315":"POST \/_msearch\n    {\n      \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n          \"must\": [\n            {\n              \"match\": {\n                \"VAERS_ID\": \"1020974-1\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"match\": {\n                \"VAERS_ID\": \"309556-1\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"range\": {\n                \"TODAYS_DATE\": {\n                  \"gte\": \"2021-08-10\",\n                  \"lte\": \"2021-08-11\"\n                }\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"range\": {\n                \"VAERS_ID\": {\n                  \"gte\": \"1000001-1\",","9038":"```json\n{\n    \"size\": 100,\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"vaers_id\": \"2021351932\"\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"@timestamp\": {\n                            \"gte\": \"2021-08-27T16:31:46.796Z\",\n                            \"lte\": \"2021-08-27T16:31:46.797Z\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"should\": [\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"recvdate\": \"2021-08-","2952":"```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"should\": [\n                {\n                    \"match_phrase\": {\n                        \"age_yrs\": \"45.0\"\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"hospdays\": {\n                            \"gt\": 45.0\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"minimum_should_match\": 1\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n##### 3.2.6.7.

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!\n\nComment: Does your code work? It seems to me that you are missing the `while` loop in your program.\n\nComment: Hi @Rafael, thank you for responding! My code works fine when I do not put in the while loop, however I have been asked to include it in my code so that it can run through all of the prompts provided in the input file.\n\nAnswer: Your problem is in this line:\n\n\\begin{code}\nresponse = int(input(\"\"\"\" + choice + \":\" + \" Enter your response: \"))\n\\end","7556":"Elasticsearch query:\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"clinical_notes\": \"Find any cases where the vaccine recipients were allergic to guanfacine.\"\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"bool\": {\n                        \"should\": [\n                            {\n                                \"range\": {\n                                    \"vax_age_yrs\": {\n                                        \"gte\": 0\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            },\n                            {\n                                \"range\": {\n                                    \"vax_age_yrs\": {\n                                        \"lte\": 17\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            },\n                            {\n                                \"range\": {","9492":"Elasticsearch query:\n[\n{\"took\":6,\"timed_out\":false,\"_shards\":{\"total\":5,\"successful\":5,\"skipped\":0},\"hits\":{\"total\":1,\"max_score\":1.0,\"hits\":[{\"_index\":\"vax\",\"_type\":\"clinical-notes\",\"_id\":\"1\",\"_score\":1.0,\"_source\":{\"RECVDATE\":\"2021-02-06\",\"STATE\":\"North Carolina\",\"AGE_YRS\":13,\"VAERS_ID\":\"US0095075132201USA005784\",\"SEX\":\"Female\",\"SYMPTOM_TEXT\":\"Pt was seen in ED 1\/31\/21 for complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath.

The code is in Python, but it is so complicated I can't figure out what to do.\n\nComment: You need to break down the code into smaller parts and try to understand each part. For example, in the last line of the code snippet, there is an `input()` function call. This means that the user needs to enter some input before the program continues.\n\nAnswer: You could just paste that into a python shell or IDE, and run it, and then look at the output.

If thats the case you can use an API such as https:\/\/www.pdf2textapi.com\/ which will convert your PDF file to a text file. You can also use a library like PyPDF2 (https:\/\/pybrary.net\/pyPdf\/) to extract the text directly from the PDF.

For example, the table above contains fields like [RECVDATE] which can be used as the primary key (a unique identifier) to identify each record. To build the index you need to create the structure of the index. This is done by specifying the schema of the index.\n\nCreate the index using the `create_index` function.

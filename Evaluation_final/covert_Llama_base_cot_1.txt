## Query

The `Query` object is used to perform a search of the data in an index. It is an array of objects, each containing the details of a particular query that should be run against the data. The type of each object in the array determines what kind of query it is. You can use"
10127,"```
{
  ""query"": {
    ""bool"": {
      ""must"": [
        {
          ""match"": {
            ""clinical_notes"": ""FLUX""

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that `clinical_notes` is a text field so we have to use the `match` operator which looks for exact string matches instead of using the default `phrase_prefix` operator which searches for partial phrase matches.

### Exercise 5

In this exercise you will use a function to read a text file that contains a list of questions and answers. You will have to answer these questions using the Elasticsearch database. For example, one of the questions might be “What is the patient’s age?” The expected output would be a list containing the patient’s age in years.

1. Create a new Python script called `exercise5.py`
2. Copy the following code into your script

```python

You can also upload a list of Elasticsearch queries (one per line) to a file called `queries.txt` and run it as follows:

```bash
$./run_vax.sh -c queries.txt
```

## Testing

To run tests in development mode, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine.

```bash
docker build -t vaccine-analyzer.
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 vaccine-analyzer
```

# Data Analysis
### Q1. How many vaccinated children in 2018 died after vaccination?
#### Explanation:
The following query will return the number of records where the patient has died after receiving a vaccine. The query uses the ""terms"" function to match the ""vaers_id"" field to the list of vaers ids provided by the question. The ""must"" function ensures that only records where the patient has died after receiving a vaccine are returned.
```elasticSearchQuery
{""query"":{""bool"":{""must"":{""terms"":{""vaers_id"":[""VAERS IDS GOES HERE""]}}}}}
```

**Hint:** The patient ID is a `string` while the symptom text is a `text`. So you need to use different types of queries.

**Note:** It's not necessary that your query matches the exact value given in the prompt. You can also apply `wildcard"

**Q1.** Consider the following code snippet to identify a patient with COVID-19 infection using [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch). 

```java
// Identify if the patient is suffering from COVID-19
if (patient.hasSymptom(""COVID-19"")) {
    // Patient has COVID-19 infection
} else {
    // Patient does not have COVID-19 infection
}
```

How can you optimize this code so that it takes less time to execute?

**Ans.** The above code will work for only one symptom of COVID-19. For example, if the patient has the following symptoms:

The answer is not what I want as you can see I have a date and then I want to get the values of vaccine type and lot number.

Comment: Could you please post your expected output?

Comment: The expected output would be like this:

```[{""index"": {""_index"": ""clinical-data"", ""_type"": ""vax-data""}},
{""index"": {""_index"": ""clinical-data"", ""_type"": ""vax-data""}},

Comment: This is not an answer to the problem you're trying to solve.  You need to post your code as a [mcve] so we can see what you've tried and where you are stuck.  As it stands, this isn't really an answer at all.

Comment: @DavidC.Rankin i just posted my code, can you help me out?

Comment: I see that now.  You might want to consider posting your question in a different manner.  I think the problem you're trying to solve is better served by showing your effort.  Perhaps provide a link to the data set (if it exists) or some sample data and what you've attempted.  Also, since this is not working as expected, you should be more specific about what is happening, what you expect to happen and any error messages.

The answer to the question is in the Clinical notes section of the response: ""342,168 people in US and 40,192 in Russia"".

## Solution

The following steps are used to create an answer for the question.

1. Create a `QuestionAnswering` instance using the input question as the parameter.
2. Extract the specific conditions for each question from the input text.
3. Create a `DatabaseQuery` object based on the extracted conditions.
4. Run the `DatabaseQuery` object against the targeted database to generate the SQL statement.
5. Execute the generated SQL statement to get the result.

Comment: So you've got a `Question` class that contains an `answers` property? If so, why not just do something like `[Question] answers = questions.Select(q => q.answers).ToList()`?

Comment: @JonSkeet I am doing something like this but it is not working because there are two classes Question and Answer. I have to use one of these two classes in the lambda expression.

Comment: @JonSkeet The code which I wrote above works fine, but I need to use one of the two classes as parameter in the lambda expression.

Answer: If you're using C# 7 or later, you can write this quite simply as:

\begin{code}
var results = from q in questions
              join a in answers on q equals a into ans
              select new { q, a };

This example is a bit contrived in that it could be done more simply without the use of regexp, but I think you get the idea here. You will need to have some basic knowledge of SQL. The most important thing to remember is that you can access a subfield within a column using dot notation (e.g., SUBSTRING(columnname.subfieldname, startindex, endindex).

Now, let's look at how to extract text out of a PDF using a Python script. Here we use PyPDF2. We will create an example script called pdfextract.py. This will take a single argument which is the path to a PDF file. This file must exist locally and not be remote. It must also be a valid PDF document. The output of"

**Clarification**: The goal of this problem is to identify a patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 within a year after vaccination and was subsequently hospitalized within 3 months of diagnosis. The number of patients in our dataset that satisfy these conditions will be returned as the answer. 

**Explanation**: In order to find out how many patients are 70.0 years old, we need to know the number of patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within a year after vaccination and were subsequently hospitalized within 3 months of diagnosis.

The first step is to identify all patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within a year after vaccination. We can do this by searching the `VAERS_ID` field in the `VAERS` table for any entries that contain ""COVID-19"". This will return a list"

Comment: This should work but I am not sure if it will work as expected because of how you are writing to the output stream. You can't write to a file object twice (unless you flush it). So either write to a temporary file and rename or just use `stdout` to write your JSON. Also, please provide the error message you get when running the code above."

Comment: You are asking a question about how to do something in an unknown language, but you haven't even given us enough information to know what language it is! If you don't tell us what programming language you are using, we can't help you!

Comment: I have updated my post with details of my code. Please check it out and let me know if you need more information.

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item Use regex to get the fields from the input string (as per your example).
\item Then use `get` to find the corresponding value from the dictionary for each field
\end{itemize}

Something like:

\begin{code}
import re

input_string = ""###[ List all records that had Biopsy lung associated with the vaccination. ]""

dictionary = {
    ""RECVDATE"": """
12689,"{ ""query"": { ""bool"": { ""must"": [ { ""match"": { ""RECVDATE"": ""2021-08-27"" } }, { ""terms"": { ""SYMPTOM_TEXT"": [""Skin sensitisation""] } } ], ""filter"": [ { ""range"": { ""VAERS_ID"": { ""gte"": ""435269"" } } }, { ""term"": { ""HOSPDAYS"": null } } ] } } }

Comment: I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because questions about code that doesn't work are off topic for Stack Overflow unless you provide a [mcve] of your code

Comment: You should always read the error message before asking a question. The error is telling you exactly what you need to do. The answer is right in front of your eyes.

Comment: @Nick i dont know how to fix it so i asked here.

Answer: Your problem is this line:

\begin{code}
doc = {""$set"": { ""fields"" : doc }}
\end{code}

You are trying to set `doc` (the document) to itself. This won't work.

What you probably want is something like this:

\begin{code}
for key,value in fields.items():
    doc[""$set""]"

The solution to this problem is a simple one liner. We use regex pattern matching to match each of the field names in the clinical notes and extract them into variables.

We can then use these variables to generate the query string. The following code snippet does exactly that.

```python
import re

pattern = r""[a-zA-Z]+\s+([^\s]+)\s+([^\s]+)""

for line in open(""input.txt"", ""r"").readlines():
    # RECVDATE, STATE, AGE_YRS, VAERS_ID, SEX, SYMPTOM_TEXT, DIED, ER_VISIT, L_THREAT, HOSPIT"

**Example:** The following example shows how to use the `run` command line interface to train a model using the [SageMaker Notebook instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html) training option.

Comment: So what's your question?

Comment: I don't know how to get the patient details of a particular patient id in Elastic search database?

Comment: You can use [term filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-term-filter.html) and [terms aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html). The first one will help you to select patient ids, and the second one - to aggregate them by their age.

Comment: @Talee I am new to Elasticsearch can you please give an example of it using my sample data?

Comment: How about using an OR operator between two different conditions? I am trying to pull data from multiple tables in a single query but only getting one table's data (I have edited my question).

Answer: If you want to get the patients that are either dead or had an emergency room visit you can use the following query:

\begin{code}
GET /_search {
""query"": {
  ""bool"": {
    ""must"": [
      {
        ""term"": {
          ""RECVDATE"": ""2019-01-10""
        }
      },
      {
        ""term"": {
          ""STAGE"": ""DEAD""
        }
      },
      {
        ""term"": {
          ""STAGE"": ""ER""
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
}"

                    }

Answer: This is a good approach to extracting the information you need. However, there are a few things that can be improved upon in your code. Firstly, when using `df.select()` it is not necessary to create separate variables for each column. Instead, you can just pass all of the column names directly into `df.select()`. Additionally, instead of using `==` to compare strings, you can use `===` which will ensure that the values are actually equal (i.e. not just containing the same text). Lastly, instead of using `df.filter()` you could use `df.loc` or even better, `df.query`. Here is an example of how you might rewrite your code:

```python

df ="
2612,"```
{
  ""query"": {
    ""bool"": {
      ""must"": [
        {
          ""match"": {
            ""receiveddate"": {
              ""query"": ""10/21/2021"",
              ""type"": ""date""
            }
          }
        },
        {
          ""term"": {
            ""vaersid.keyword"": ""VAERS ID""
          }
        }
      ],
      ""should"": [
        {
          ""match"": {
            ""state.keyword"": ""State""
          }
        },
        {
          ""term"": {
            ""ageyrs.keyword"": ""Age Yrs""
          }
        },
        {
          ""match"": {
            ""sex.keyword"": ""Sex""
          }
        },
        {
          ""term"": {"
2626,"{
    ""took"": 5,
    ""timed_out"": false,
    ""failed"": {
        ""type"": ""illegal_argument_exception"",
        ""reason"": ""Failed to parse query [{\""match\"": {\""recvdate\"": \""06/07/2021\""}}].""
    }
}
```

The above example uses a string as the input for the query generation. The format of the string is a bit more complex than what is shown here but is similar in concept.

You can also provide an array of conditions. Each item in the array is handled as if it were a separate question. In other words, each item is parsed by the `parse` function and used to generate an individual query.

```
Example:

Input:
Question: ### Recent deaths (within the last 30 days) where did they pass away"
2634,"```json
{
    ""query"": {
        ""bool"": {

                },

                        ""@timestamp"": {

#### Solution #4

This solution uses a simple loop to check all possible fields for each symptom. The solution uses a list of all possible fields that could contain the symptoms. For example, if the patient has 'Diarrhea' as one of their symptoms, we will need to look at the following fields in order to determine the date of death: RECVDATE, ER_VISIT, and HOSPITAL. The code below loops through all the possible fields and returns the first field that matches the criteria.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def find_elastic_query(fields, conditions):
    """"""Finds an Elasticsearch query string based on the input fields and conditions.

    ""term"": {
      ""vaers_id"": 9"
2836,"```json
{

        {
          ""match"": {

          }
        },
        {
          ""range"": {
            ""clinicalNotes.dateOfHospitalization"": {
              ""gte"": ""2016-09-30T00:00:00Z"",
              ""lte"": ""2017-04-08T00:00:00Z""

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

}
```

*The above query returns a list of records where ""hospdays"" is greater than or equal to 1.0 and the record has a date in its ""recvdate"" field that matches the date specified in the question.*

#### 5.3.4 Clinical Notes Query Generation

For the clinical notes query generation, we need to identify the following fields in the question:

* **Question type"
3037,"[{""@timestamp"":""2022-09-15T16:13:57.838Z"",""@version"":""1"",""text"":""How many patients were hospitalized for 114.0 days.""}]
```

**In this case, we want to get all the clinical notes that contain the following condition: [How many patients were hospitalized for 114.0 days.]**

The following is a sample of what you can expect from our solution:

Answer: \strong{First}: You have to read the data in a collection (in your case you will read it in the variable `records`) so that you can do something like:

\begin{code}
var record = records.Find(i => i.VAERS_ID == vaersId);
\end{code}

If you don't do that, you won't be able to use the `find` method because you need a collection type, not a string.

\strong{Second}: The find method only searches for elements where the given property matches the given parameter. So if you want to search for multiple properties, you have to create"

The following are some examples of how you can use the `vaccine_reports` subcommand.

```
$./cli vaccine_reports
$./cli vaccine_reports -h
```

<!-- ## Examples

Here is an example of a query that will retrieve all the reports for the date 2022-05-14:

```
vaccine_reports '2022-05-14'
```

You can also retrieve all the reports where the user has indicated that they have had a reaction:

```
vaccine_reports 'has_had_a_reaction"

```
Input: ""Hello World!""
Output: [""Hello"", ""World!""]

Input: ""I don't like cats.""
Output: [""I"", ""don't"", ""like"", ""cats.""]

Input: """"
Output: []

Input: ""a""
Output: [""a""]
```

### QnA (Question and Answer)
The `QnA` API provides a set of question-and-answer pairs, which helps developers to provide an answer to the user’s questions. It supports two types of question-and-answer pairs: FAQs and knowledge bases. This module focuses on FAQs. The following figure shows how the `QnA` works.

The reason why I am doing it like that is because the questions are dynamic, they can change. I know how to create a map of questions and their answers, but if someone asks me ""What is the number of cases where the interval from the vaccination date to the onset date is 28.0 days?"" there is no way for me to just search through my map to find the answer. So what I want to do is have a list of fields and a condition pertaining to each field (e.g. `STAGE_OF_DISEASE`,`INTERVAL_FROM_VACCINATION_TO_ONSET`), and then generate the appropriate Elasticsearch query based on the field and condition. If the question is something like ""What is the number of cases where the interval from the vaccination date to the onset date is 28.0 days"

Comment: This is not a code review site; you should be asking on https://codereview.stackexchange.com/.

Comment: I just edited your answer to add the missing `]` characters, but it's still not clear what's going on here (I can't run it). It would help if you could explain what your code is doing and why.

Comment: @DavidGrayson: Thanks for the reply. The code was added by me, which will pull data from elastic search database. I am using the above code as reference, so that I don't need to write my own code for pulling the data from elastic search database.

## Data Modeling & Visualization

The following is an example of data modeling using [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana). The data source is the same as above. The visualization below shows the percentage of patients who received each type of vaccine by age group and the percentage of patients that had severe reactions by type of vaccine. The legend on the right shows the color coding used to identify each vaccine type. The line chart in the middle shows how the percentage of patients with severe reaction varies by age group.

The issue is that I don't know how to find the answer from all of these text files in one go. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Comment: Please clarify your specific problem or provide additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it's hard to tell exactly what you're asking.

Answer: You can use `sed` to replace the text.

\begin{code}
sed -E ""s/([^<]+)<\/a>/\1>/g"" <file.txt >new-file.txt
\end{code}

`[^<]` matches everything except \begin{code}
<
\end{code}, so we are replacing every line starting with something else than \begin{code}
<
\end{code}.

Then we are replacing the last occurrence of \begin{code}

Comment: This is really not helpful. The problem is that you're asking a question but not telling us anything about your code. You say ""I have tried many things"" but we don't know what those things are. Please post some code so that we can see where the problem might be.

Comment: @DaveHogan I've edited my question, now it includes more details about the program. Also please note that I am just a beginner to python, so I am not sure how to explain the situation further.

Answer: First of all, you need to learn about [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). It's an amazing package for data manipulation and analysis.

Comment: @RandyHayes Thank you so much for your response. I would like to identify if any patient has ever been prescribed Vyvanse.

Comment: If you mean whether any patient has ever had a record of having taken it within the last year, that can be done using something like `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [LAB_DATA]) > 0`. This will return true if at least one patient has taken it in the past year, but not if they took it more than a year"

Comment: Thanks for answering! I'm not sure if I understand correctly though. My problem is that there are multiple conditions (for example, I want to find all patients who have a condition of both ""anemia"" and ""blood pressure"") in my database. How do I use your code to look at multiple conditions?"

**Question 5:**

You will be provided a sample of clinical notes extracted from EMRs. Identify the fields in the clinical note that could potentially be used to identify high risk patients (e.g., those with prior conditions or hospitalizations) and write an Elasticsearch query that will retrieve such records. You must use a multi-field query.

**Input:**

Prompt: ### Elasticsearch database with field names:
# RECVDATE, STATE, AGE_YRS, VAERS_ID, SEX, SYMPTOM_TEXT, DIED, ER_VISIT, L_THREAT, HOSPITAL, HOSPDAYS, DISABLE, VAX_DATE, LAB_DATA, OTHER_MEDS, CUR_ILL, HISTORY, PRIOR"

Comment: Does your program run without errors?

Comment: no it doesn't...it just gives an error that says the method ""parse"" is undefined...I have updated my question with the code I am using now.

Comment: That's a different error message than before, and it looks like you have two parse methods in your code. The one in the other class should be static, so you can call it like `Parse.parse(question);`

Comment: Thank you! It worked!

Answer: Your `parse` method needs to return an object of type `Condition` (or something else). Currently, it returns nothing. So when you try to store it in your map, it will throw an exception because it cannot convert a `String` to a `Map`.

You need to add some logic to check if the input string is a valid condition or not. If it is, return an"

###### QUESTION 4:
```
Question: Given the following JSON structure

    ""id"":""1"",

7026,"\end{code}

I was able to get it to work when I had one if statement but when I add another if statement it stops working. I think it is because the second if statement uses the same variable `if(isDepressed==true)` but I am not sure how to change it so that it works. If you could help me out I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you in advance!

Comment: You need to use a different variable name for each if statement. It doesn't matter what you call them as long as they don't overlap.

Comment: Are there any other problems with your code? You have unused variables and unnecessary parentheses around some conditions.

Answer: The problem is that both the variables named ""isDepressed"" are being assigned to true, which means only the last if statement will be executed. So you can try something like this:

The `prompt` text contains all of the conditions to match in a single sentence. We also include some extra information about the question that is not part of the prompt. The `text` property contains the full text of the question that was asked. This will be used when generating the output response.

We can use the `text` field as well to provide additional information. In this example, we have provided a description of what the user should do if they want to see more examples. For example, if you are using our bot in a hospital setting and you wanted to train it to recognize different types of clinical notes, you could ask questions like these:

> ### How often does this patient have diabetes?
> ### What is the most common type of cancer for this patient?

Comment: Does your code contain a line that reads `while True:`? If so, that's where your infinite loop is happening.

Comment: Yes it does @NickWatson

Comment: If you have a while loop, why are you trying to do something outside of that while loop? The while loop will just keep running over and over again until it finds a way out (i.e., the code in the body of the loop ends). So if you want to stop the loop, you need to either put a `break` statement inside the while loop or put an `else` statement after it.

7184,"# Fibrocystic breast disease (FBD) is a benign proliferative disorder of the breast characterized by cysts filled with fluid in the breast tissue. It affects more than half of women during their reproductive years. However, not all fibrocystic breasts are due to FBD. Other conditions such as fat necrosis or inflammatory breast cancer can present with similar clinical findings. In general, any woman who has dense breasts that feel lumpy should see her doctor. FBD can also be seen in men who have gynecomastia.

The answer is a JSON object containing two properties: `took` and `"

\end{code}

Comment: This answer is incorrect as it will return results where `age_yrs` is not a number or string. The correct answer should be `(state = ""VA"" AND age_yrs >= 80)`.

Answer: You could do something like this. I'm assuming your variable 'query' has the following format:

Comment: Is there a reason why you don't use a `regex`? https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/re

Comment: Are you using Python 2 or 3? (The `input()` function was removed in Python 3.)

Comment: Can you provide a sample input and your expected output?

Comment: @AbhinavSingh Sorry, I forgot to add the input. It's been updated now.

Answer: You can use regex for this task. I would recommend starting with a simple regex and then building on it as needed. This will not work with the current data format, but will give you a good start to build off of.

I have tried everything to get it to work but I can't seem to find anything that will do what I want it to do. It has to take each line and break it down into two fields: The First line needs to be stored in a variable called `Question` and the second line needs to be stored in a variable called `Answer`.

Comment: The first line is a comment so it should not be parsed at all. You need to add a `^` before that line to make sure it is ignored. For example: `^.*$`. See [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/309424/how-to-ignore-a-line-in-awk) for more information.

Comment: I am trying to do a query in elastic search for a specific date. I know that I need to use the query in json format. But I don't know how to construct it. The example they give is very vague as well. I can see the queries are done with multiple different types of data. So if I want to find a specific patient who has had a prior vaccination I can't figure out which one to use.

Comment: I'm not sure if this is an answer to your question or a different question altogether, but how can you get data out of a PDF file? I thought those were images.

Comment: @KellyBundy You need to use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software to convert text from image into text.

Answer: The question is vague in terms of what you are trying to achieve. Is it that you want to process PDF files with some kind of NLP, or do you want to parse PDFs for some specific purpose, e.g. to extract some metadata from them?

If the latter, there are many ways to do it depending on your use case. If you only care about certain fields, for example, you could just grab the text in those fields. However, if you want to be able to extract any piece of text that appears in a PDF, you would have"

I've also tried to use.find() but I get error that says ""TypeError: Cannot read property 'find' of undefined"" when running the code.

Answer: There are many things wrong here:
\begin{itemize}
\item You have a syntax error in your `Prompt` statement. You cannot use a double quotation mark inside a single quotation mark. So you should do something like:
\end{itemize}

\begin{code}
prompt = input('Enter Prompt:') # This will work
\end{code}

\begin{itemize}
\item In your `input()` function you are not doing anything with your variable. It is just going unused. Try this instead:
\end{itemize}

\begin{code}
def prompt():
    global prompt
    prompt = input('Enter Prompt:')"

Comment: You're not supposed to ask people to do your work for you. If you've made an attempt to solve the problem yourself, show us what you did and where you ran into trouble so we can help you get unstuck.

Comment: @Cody I'm trying to learn how to do this, so I am making an attempt. I just don't know where to start or how to even begin writing a script to read through each line in a csv file. Can anyone provide any hints?

Answer: If it was me, I would probably write a simple program that reads the data one line at a time and writes out another CSV file containing only those rows that match the criteria given by the user. The original CSV file would have its first line commented out so that the resulting file looks like:

\begin{code}
#RECVDATE,STATE,AGE_YRS,VA"
933,"```elasticsearch
""query"": {
    ""bool"": {
        ""must"": [
            {""range"": {
                ""AGE_YRS"": {
                    ""gte"": 76.0
                }
            }}
        ]
    }
}
```

- The first step is to identify the first field name in the prompt, which is `RECVDATE`.
- Then we look at the next line of the prompt, which asks us to find all records where the `VAERS_ID` is `VAERS ID 1843267`
- We can match the prompted condition by generating a query that matches only `VAERS_ID` values that are equal to `VAERS ID 1843267`.

The following example shows how to generate a query that will retrieve clinical notes that contain the word ""Severe"".

**Example:**

```json

            {
                ""text"": ""This is a test document"",

                    ""STATE"": ""VA"",
                    ""AGE_YRS"": 41,
                    ""VAERS_ID"": """
9659,"```elasticsearch
""VAERS""-[ ""returned"" : true ]
```

### Exercise 3 - Generating a list of patients who have symptoms

#### Prompt: 
##### Given the following conditions (age_yrs < 5, sex = female), identify the patients in the clinical notes. The data is stored in Elasticsearch format. 

**Note**: The Elasticsearch query will be used to search through the database and generate the result. You can refer to [Elasticsearch Docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-bool-query.html) to learn more about building a boolean query. 

#### Answer:
```elasticsearch
""VAERS""-[ ""returned"" : true, ""age_yrs"" < 5, ""sex"" = ""f"

    ""query"": {
        ""bool"": {
            ""must"": [

                        ""@recvdate"": {

                        }
                    }
                }
            ],
            ""filter"": [
                {
                    ""bool"": {
                        ""should"": [
                            {

                                }
                            },
                            {
                                ""match"": {
                                    ""age_yrs"": ""15""
                                }
                            }"
968,"{
  ""query"": {
    ""bool"": {
      ""must"": [
        {
          ""range"": {
            ""AGE_YRS"": {
              ""gte"": 15.0
            }
          }
        },
        {
          ""range"": {
            ""VAERS_ID"": {
              ""gte"": ""2407693""
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also provide a `Query` object to generate the Elasticsearch query. This is useful when you want to combine multiple queries together. For example, you might want to return all records where the `age_yrs` is greater than 15 and the `vaers_id` is equal to 2407693.

```yaml
---
title: Sample
output: el"
9681,"```python
query = {
    ""bool"": {
        ""must"": [
            {""range"": {""recvdate"": {""gte"": ""2022-04-18""}}}
        ],
    },
}
```

#### 3.2.1.2 Elastic Search Query: Given a list of conditions, identify the fields to be extracted from the clinical note and generate the corresponding Elasticsearch query based on the condition and the identified field. 
**Example**:
```text
prompt: ### Elasticsearch database with field names:
# RECVDATE, STATE, AGE_YRS, VAERS_ID, SEX, SYMPTOM_TEXT, DIED, ER_VISIT, L_THREAT, HOSPITAL, HOSPDAYS, DISABLE, VAX_DATE, LAB_DATA, OTHER_ME"
9696,"```
{
    ""query"": {
        ""bool"": {
            ""must"": [
                {
                    ""range"": {
                        ""receiveddate"": {
                            ""gte"": ""2021-01-14"",
                            ""lte"": ""2021-01-15""
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    ""term"": {
                        ""state"": ""VAERS ID - Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)""
                    }
                }

This type of cataract results in blurry vision and can be corrected by eyeglasses. It is caused by age-related changes within the lens that make it cloudy and hard for light to pass through it. The second most common type of cataract is cortical cataract, which accounts for approximately 7% of all cases. This type occurs when calcium deposits form around the edge of your eye's lens over time, making it difficult to focus on objects at a distance. Cortical cataracts are usually treated with surgery because they tend to grow larger over time if left untreated.\n###[ Which is the most common cause of glaucoma? ]\nAnswer:\nThe most common cause of glaucoma is aging.

Our query\nwould support all three syntaxes since we are matching a single value against a field.\n### The regex syntax allows us to use regular expressions to find words in a string.\nIn this case, the regex is \u201cUSPFIZER INC2021018154","7833":"-2021-08-29 05:44:26 - What is the number of vaccine recipients that had an allergic to beta?

This condition can cause symptoms such as breast pain and tenderness, as well as changes in the appearance of the breast. It can also make it more difficult to detect cancer during a mammogram. Fibrocystic disease of the breast is very common, affecting approximately half of all women at some point in their lives. It usually begins around age 20 and tends to decrease after menopause. There is no known cure for this condition, but there are treatments that can help relieve symptoms. If you have been diagnosed with fibrocystic disease of the breast, it's important to be familiar with the signs and symptoms so you can talk to your doctor about any changes in your breast health. ###[ What is the most common fibrocystic breast?","3732":"ElasticSearch:\n      must:\n        - bool:\n            must:\n              match:\n                recvdate: \"2019-08-15\"\n```\n\n#### Elasticsearch Query for Question: \"Give me all the patients who have a history of prior vaccinations within 1 year of their symptom onset.\"\n\nPrompt: ### Elasticsearch database with field names:\n# RECVDATE, STATE, AGE_YRS, VAERS_ID, SEX, SYMPTOM_TEXT, DIED, ER_VISIT, L_THREAT, HOSPITAL, HOSPDAYS, DISABLE, VAX_DATE, LAB_DATA, OTHER_MEDS, CUR_ILL, HISTORY, PRIOR_VAX, TODAYS_DATE, OFC_VISIT, VAX_","1093":"[{\"hits\":[{\"_index\":\"vaxxed\",\"_type\":\"records\",\"_id\":\"2569\",\"_score\":1,\"fields\":{\"VAERS_ID\":\"1538797\",\"AGE_YRS\":\"4.0\",\"STATE\":\"NJ\"},\"_source\":{\"RecDate\":\"2021-12-02T09:42:45.000Z\",\"Reaction\":\"Generalized tonic-clonic seizure\",\"Outcome\":\"Recovering\",\"SideEffects\":\"Fainting\",\"SymptomText\":\"felt faint; fell and hit head on floor\",\"Diagnosis\":\"Head injury\",\"ERVisit\":\"No\",\"LabData\":\"none\",\"OtherMed\":\"none\",\"CurrentIllness\":\"None\",\"Hospital\":\"No\",\"HospitalDays\":\"No\",\"Disabled\":\"No\",\"VaxDate\":\"2021-12-02\",\"","9664":"```json\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"received_date\": {\n                            \"gte\": \"2022-02-23\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n[End of code]\n\n### Solution: \nThe answer is a JSON object that defines a boolean search query using the \u201cmust\u201d clause.

Symptoms may include fever, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, seizures, difficulty speaking, loss of vision, paralysis, and confusion. Children may have decreased muscle tone and abnormal reflexes.

We can also ask for all the patients that have more than one diagnosis, or all the patients that have more than one note, etc.\n### In the above question, there are several conditions, but only one of them is being used by the system. This is because the other conditions are optional and they are not required in order to answer the question.

Here, the first condition is \u201dhas diagnosis\u201d and then the second condition is \u201dhas notes\u201d.

It will tokenize and analyze your textual data and produce a score based on the results. In order to do that, it needs to have a set of fields defined in its configuration. This can be done at the index level, but in your case I would recommend doing this per index. You can define the fields in your `elasticsearch-mappings.yml`:\n\n\\begin{code}\n# this mapping defines which fields are used by the query string query type\n# it must match the structure of the text you are searching\ntext_fields:\n    # field name and type here, e.g.,'symptom_text' and 'keyword'\n    symptom_text: keyword\n    state: keyword\n    age_","1553":"```elasticsearch\nPOST \/test\/_msearch\n{\n  \"size\": 100,\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"filter\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": {\n            \"state\": \"NJ\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"range\": {\n            \"@timestamp\": {\n              \"gte\": \"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n              \"lte\": \"2021-04-30T00:00:00Z\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"should\": [\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"symptom_text\": \"Tympanic membrane disorder\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","714":"\\begin{code}\n    # Elasticsearch query for the question above:\n    {\n        \"query\": {\n            \"bool\": {\n                \"must\": [\n                    {\n                        \"match\": {\n                            \"RECVDATE\": {\n                                \"query\": \"2016-07-01\",\n                                \"operator\": \"gte\"\n                            }\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"match\": {\n                            \"STATE\": {\n                                \"query\": \"NJ\",\n                                \"operator\": \"eq\"\n                            }\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"range\": {\n                            \"AGE_YRS\": {\n                                \"gt\": 50,\n                                \"lt\": 75\n                            }\n                        }\n                    },","4087":"[ \"number\": 1 ]\n[ \"name\": \"adverse_event\" ]\n[ \"value\": \"onset_date\" ]\n[ \"value\": \"07\/22\/2013\" ]\n[ \"type\": \"range\" ]\n[ \"operator\": \">\" ]\n[ \"name\": \"symptom\" ]\n[ \"type\": \"text\" ]\n[ \"operator\": \"is\" ]\n[ \"value\": \"symptom_text\" ]\n[ \"type\": \"bool\" ]\n[ \"must\": true ]\n[ \"query\": { \"range\": { \"onset_date\": { \"gte\": \"2013-07-22T00:00:00Z\" } } } ]\n\n### Next, we will execute the generated query in Elasticsearch and return the results\nas a list.

Finally, it includes the\nkeyword \"RL\", which tells us that we'll need to find the value of \"RL\" from each record\nin our database.\n\nWe can now use these keywords to create an answer template. We start by creating a new\nanswer template called `es-count-rl`. This template will take in a set of arguments,\nwhich include the following:\n\n* `question` - The question to answer.\n*","10769":"```json\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"VAERS_ID\": {\n                            \"gt\": 1619\n                        }\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"VAERS_ID\": {\n                            \"gte\": 1619\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"should\": [],\n            \"must_not\": []\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n### The following is a sample of what an Elasticsearch response looks like:\n```json\n{\n    \"_shards\" : {\n        \"total\" : 5,\n        \"successful\" : 5,\n        \"skipped\" : 0\n    },\n    \"took","7332":"{\n    \"from\": 0,\n    \"size\": 10,\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"should\": [\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"receiveddate\": \"2021-08-14\"\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"age_yrs\": {\n                            \"gte\": 15,\n                            \"lte\": 16\n                        }\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"hospitaldays\": {\n                            \"gte\": 3,\n                            \"lt\": 4\n                        }\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"bool\": {\n                        \"should\": [\n                            {\n                                \"range\":","10466":"10. \nQuestion:\n### How many GLAXOSMITHKLINE BIOLOGICALS vaccine has been used?\nPrompt: ### Elasticsearch database with field names:\n# RECVDATE, STATE, AGE_YRS, VAERS_ID, SEX, SYMPTOM_TEXT, DIED, ER_VISIT, L_THREAT, HOSPITAL, HOSPDAYS, DISABLE, VAX_DATE, LAB_DATA, OTHER_MEDS, CUR_ILL, HISTORY, PRIOR_VAX, TODAYS_DATE, OFC_VISIT, VAX_TYPE, VAX_MANU, VAX_LOT, VAX_DOSE_SERIES, VAX_NAME, ALLERGIES### [Question]\n### To generate the Elasticsearch query for","1109":"3874\n\n- Answered by @sahiljain1521 on April 26, 2021 at 9:54 PM\n\n### [How many patients had a diagnosis of \"pneumonia\" and died within 3 days?]\nAnswer:\n1614\n\n- Answered by @sahiljain1521 on April 26, 2021 at 9:54 PM\n\n### [Which symptoms did patients have who were admitted to hospital?]\nAnswer:\n100.0% had Fever\n\n- Answered by @sahiljain1521 on April 26, 2021 at 9:54 PM\n\n### [What is the percentage of female patients that received the vaccine?]\nAnswer:\n100.","7771":"```\n{\n\"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n        \"should\": [\n            {\n                \"match\": {\n                    \"VAERS_ID\": \"VAERS ID\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"match\": {\n                    \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\": \"insect\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"match\": {\n                    \"AGE_YRS\": \"age_yrs\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"match\": {\n                    \"VAERS_ID\": \"VAERS ID\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"match\": {\n                    \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\": \"walnut\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"match\": {\n                    \"AGE_YRS\": \"age_yrs\"\n                }\n            }","1378":"[{\"id\": \"4831952\", \"date\": \"2021-06-10T00:00:00.000Z\", \"state\": \"CA\", \"age_yrs\": 16, \"vaers_id\": \"757455\", \"sex\": \"Male\", \"symptom_text\": \"Myocarditis, MI\", \"died\": \"No\", \"er_visit\": \"Yes\", \"l_threat\": \"High\", \"hospital\": \"No\", \"hospdays\": \"Unknown\", \"disable\": \"No\", \"vax_date\": \"2021-05-07T00:00:00.000Z\", \"lab_data\": \"\", \"other_meds\": \"\", \"cur_ill\": \"\", \"history\": \"\", \"prior"}}

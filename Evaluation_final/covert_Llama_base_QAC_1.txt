Answer: The condition value is [ALLERGIES]
So we have to generate a query which will return all the clinical notes where the person had an allergy.
Condition Value = [ALLERGIES]

Filed Name = [VAERS_ID]

Condition Value = [ALLERGIES]

Comment: Hey, I'm trying to get the same information but I have no idea how you did it. Can you tell me what exactly are you searching for in the PDF and how do you convert that into code?

Comment: Hey, so if I understand correctly you are looking for a way to get the text inside the PDF file and extract it using some form of code right? If thats the case you can use an API such as https://www.pdf2textapi.com/ which will convert your PDF file to a text file. You can also use a library like PyPDF2 (https://pybrary.net/pyPdf/) to extract the text directly from the PDF. Let me know if this helps or if I misunderstood your question!

Note: The field name is [ ], which is a list of clinical notes with the format of 'Find all cases where people vaccinated in LL and LG.'
The condition value for this field is [ ], which is the condition value for the clinical note field.

```

### Explanation

1.  The code has three parts:

   1) First, we need to identify the field names. We use `prompt.split("" "")` to split the prompt into a list of strings. Then, we iterate over the string list using a `for` loop. Within each iteration, we use the `str.strip()` method to remove any whitespace at the start and end of the current string. This leaves us with a string that contains only the field name. Finally, we store the result in a variable"

I am not sure if you are asking to write a code that will run the code above or you are looking for an answer?

Comment: I am trying to find out how to use the code above. The code is in Python, but it is so complicated I can't figure out what to do.

Comment: You need to break down the code into smaller parts and try to understand each part. For example, in the last line of the code snippet, there is an `input()` function call. This means that the user needs to enter some input before the program continues.

Answer: You could just paste that into a python shell or IDE, and run it, and then look at the output.  But in general you want to break things up into small manageable steps that you can understand.

For example, you have:

### Data Setup - ElasticSearch Databases

To store the information in a database it has to be extracted into an indexable format. For example, the table above contains fields like [RECVDATE] which can be used as the primary key (a unique identifier) to identify each record. To build the index you need to create the structure of the index. This is done by specifying the schema of the index.

Create the index using the `create_index` function. Create the index by providing the following arguments:

* **name** : The name of the index.
* **type** : The type of the index, either _elasticsearch_ or _postgres_.
* **schema** : The schema of"

Comment: Please edit your post to include a code sample that reproduces the problem. You should also describe what you expect to happen and what happens instead.

Comment: What does `print(question)` show before you attempt to answer it?

Comment: @KevinKinsey I have edited my question.

Comment: @NathanKlatt print(question) shows ""What are the symptoms of COVID-19?""

Answer: You're calling `answer()` when you shouldn't be. You only want to do that if the user entered a command in the shell. Otherwise, you just need to return whatever you get back from the method.

I think you may be confusing `answer()` with something like `return` which is used at the end of a function to indicate what result the function returns.

In your case, you can remove `answer()` and simply use"

Comment: Does this answer your question? [How to convert a text file into a dataframe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59164786/how-to-convert-a-text-file-into-a-dataframe)

Comment: So you want to find a particular word in the text?

Comment: @AndrewKim Yes I have a set of questions and answers that I need to generate a SQL query for. If the answer contains a certain keyword, it should return the answer as true. If not, it should return the answer as false.

Comment: Are all the keywords going to be the same length?

Comment: They can vary. The keywords are not always going to be the same length.

Answer: You could try using regex to match if there's any word that matches the string you want to match against, like so:

\begin{code}
import re

text = ""Hello world""
pattern = ""world""
match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print(""Found"")
else:
    print(""Not found"")

I know that I am doing something wrong in my code but I do not know how to fix it. Can someone help me out please? Thanks!

Comment: Please don't use images of text to ask questions. They are difficult to read, impossible to search, and often contain errors.

Comment: Sorry about that, thank you for letting me know!

Answer: I was able to get a working example by using a different function to generate the condition statement. This is what I used:

\begin{code}
def conditions(condition):
    if condition == 'ALL':
        return ''
    elif condition == 'ANY':
        return 'OR'
    else:
        return 'AND'
\end{code}"

Comment: Are you sure about your code? I ran it in my machine and there was no error.

Comment: @SaranshSingh I just tried to run it again and it works fine now. No errors at all. However when I submit an answer that contains a code block, the code does not appear. For example, I submitted this as an answer: ""I think the problem is that the code is inside a list. Try using ``` instead."" but only got this output: **I think the problem is that the code is inside a list. Try using ```** instead.**.**""**

Comment: So did you try submitting the same code without any changes or did you try submitting your own code?

Comment: @SaranshSingh Yes I tried submitting the same code. I also tried using `f'''`. It didn't work either.

##### Different Condition Value Extraction
In some cases, the user needs to extract different values from a specific field under different conditions. For example, if a person has died, we need to extract the date of death; If not dead, we need to extract the date of hospitalization. We can use two separate conditional statements to extract different values under different conditions. The following is an example:

Comment: Thanks a lot for your answer! I'm trying to figure out how to implement your code into my python code (it's not really working). Can you please give me an example of how to use the function in my code? My code is like this:
```
    def read_vax_file():
        return VaxFileReader(filename=""../data/VAERS-COVID-data-by-state.csv"")

def get_state_name(vax_reader):
    return vax_reader.get_state_name()

def get_age_years(vax_reader):
    return vax_reader.get_age_years()

Comment: Hi, can you please edit your post to include some sample data? It will make it much easier to understand what you're asking about.

Comment: I have added a sample data in the post

Comment: @JonathanBowen, Please check the post now. I have updated my question by adding the sample data

Comment: Can you share more details on how do you want to split the text? For example, in the sample data provided, there are two different conditions for ""RECVDATE"", one is `AGE_YRS` and another is `VAERS_ID`. How do you want to handle such cases?

Comment: @JonathanBowen Yes, I am sorry if i am not clear here. In my case, there can be only one condition for each field name. So, I would like to have only one condition value for each field name."

Comment: This seems like a homework problem to me. If so, you should tag it as such.

Comment: Is there any way to add a tag that says ""homework""?

Comment: I think you can edit your question and put `homework` in brackets after the title. I'm not sure though. I've never done it before.

Comment: No idea what a 'prompt' is in your context - but if it's the same thing as a 'question', you might want to look at [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14596875/how-to-extract-text-from-a-pdf) or"
7128,"The most common dry heaves for patients is DRY HEAVES
```

### Explanation of what the code does:
- Step 1: Extracts the text fields (state, age, vax date) and stores them in a dictionary.
- Step 2: Creates a new list called symptoms which will store all the different symptom strings from the input.
- Step 3: Creates a new list called conditionValues which will store all the different condition value strings from the input.
- Step 4: Uses the two lists above to create an Elasticsearch query that finds the most common symptom and the most common condition value.

### Comments on my approach:
- I was able to use the information I learned about regex to find the most common symptom and the most common condition value."

Comment: If you want to use a web scraping library, you'll need to tell us what language you are using. You could also just use the developer tools (F12) in your browser, but that might not give you the output you expect.

Comment: Sorry, I am not able to see any output after running this code, can anyone help me out?

Answer: There are a few things wrong here.

First off, you have a `print` statement inside your while loop. This means it will only ever run once.

7441,"###### This is a very simple example of how you can ask questions about your data. In this case, it would be easy to write a script that reads the clinical notes, searches for ""allergic to"", and then uses the word after ""to"" as the allergen. Then just search for ""meropenem"" in the list of allergens.

###### But what if there were thousands of potential allergens, or millions of patient records? We could use the same approach, but we would have to come up with some way to identify which patients had which allergies. We could try to read through each patient's medical record looking for a specific pattern, but that would require a lot of work and wouldn't scale well. Instead, we could use machine learning to automatically learn which words are associated with which allergies, and then use that knowledge to make predictions about new patients.

I have tried several approaches but they either return the wrong answers or an error. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Any help would be appreciated!

Comment: What have you tried? Do you get an error? If so, what is the error message? Please post your code as well.

Comment: @BhargavSailu Sorry about that, I've added my code now. Thanks for your comment!

Comment: Does the program ever run to completion, or does it exit immediately? If it exits immediately, please add the output of `pytest -v` to the question. Also, try adding a `print(my_file)` line before the `with open(my_file)` line to see if anything gets written to `my_file`.

### Prompt: 
In a previous question you learned how to use the [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-to-elasticsearch) database to analyze medical data. In this task you will create a function that generates a graph using data from the `vax_data` table in your [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-to-elasticsearch) database. This graph will plot the age of each patient (AGE_YRS), against the number of days they were hospitalized (HOSPDAYS). 

Your function should generate a plot with a title, axes labels, and a legend, as well as providing a summary of the results. Use the code below to generate the graph for the following input:

Comment: `grep` would be a better tool than `cat` here. It can print multiple lines per match, unlike cat which prints one line per input.

Answer: You could use a combination of `awk`, `cut`, `grep`, `sort`, and `uniq`:

\begin{code}
$ awk -F'[ \t]+' 'BEGIN {FS=OFS=""\t""} {print $1,$2,$3,$4}' file |
  cut -f2-3,6 |
  sort |
  uniq -c |
  sort -n |
  grep ""^[^0-9]\+[0-9]"""

#### Question 5

Prompt: ### Elasticsearch database with field names:
# RECV"
7930,"```bash
SELECT * FROM elastic_search_database WHERE received_date = ""05/07/2021""
```

##### Solution 2

Solution 2 is very similar to solution 1. But instead of using regex, we are going to use the `find()` method. This method will find all the words in a string that matches a pattern. In our case, we are looking for the word ""vaccine"". So we are going to pass the regular expression `""^vaccine""` as an argument. You can also see that we have removed the square brackets around the regular expression.

```python
def generate_elastic_query(text):
    # Prompt: ### Elasticsearch database with field names:
    # RECVDATE, STATE, AGE_YRS, VAERS_ID, SEX, SYMPTOM_TEXT, DIED, ER_"
7937,"\end{code}

##### DONE

1. What are the different types of Elasticsearch queries supported by the Health Checker?

    * Match Query - match query matches documents that have fields matching given values. It supports simple text searches, prefix searches, fuzzy searches, wildcard searches, and regular expression searches.
    * Range Query - range query matches documents whose fields are within a certain range.
    * Terms Query - terms query matches documents whose field is one of a specified set of values.
    * Wildcard Query - wildcard query matches documents whose fields contain a string"

8848,"In SQL, we can use a subquery to get the number of records that match our criteria. In Python, we can use a list comprehension to do the same thing. We start by creating a list of all the records in the database that have the conditions we are looking for. Then, we create a new list containing only those records where the condition is true. Finally, we print out how many records there were in total.
###[ What is the rate of children with meningococcale conjugated vaccine?]
Answer:
We can find the rate of children with meningococcal conjugate vaccine by using a query to find all children who have received the vaccine. This will return a list of all children who have been vaccinated. We can then take the number of children who have been vaccinated and divide it by the total number of children in the population.
This will give us a percentage"

I've tried to figure out what I did wrong but cannot seem to find it. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!

Comment: Does your code work? It seems to me that you are missing the `while` loop in your program.

Comment: Hi @Rafael, thank you for responding! My code works fine when I do not put in the while loop, however I have been asked to include it in my code so that it can run through all of the prompts provided in the input file.

Answer: Your problem is in this line:

\begin{code}
response = int(input("""""""" + choice + "":"" + "" Enter your response: ""))

### 2.4.6 Inferring Search Engine Queries

We have previously discussed how to infer queries using a simple rule-based approach. However, it would be nice if we could also generate a search engine query based on an input question. This would enable us to create a general purpose conversational agent that can answer any type of question. We will now explore how to do this by building upon our previous work on generating database queries.

In this section, we will build upon our prior work on generating database queries. We will modify our code to automatically generate a search engine query given an input question.

To get started, you will need to download the [Elasticsearch-Search-Engine](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Python"
9482,"```elasticsearch
{
""query"": {
    ""bool"": {
        ""must"": [{

            }
        }]
    }
}
}
```

Answer: There are a few things to fix in your code, as follows:

In the `else` block of your `while` loop, you need to add `break` statement after the `for` loop, so that it doesn't go into next iteration of the `while` loop, which might cause a `StackOverflowError`.

In your `if-else` statement inside the `for` loop, you have an extra space between `[ ]` and `How many people recorded on 04/20/2021.`

Also, there is no need to define a variable named `response`, because we are not using it anywhere else in the program, so we can remove that line."

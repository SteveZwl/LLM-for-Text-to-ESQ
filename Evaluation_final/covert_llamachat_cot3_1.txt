11654,"The field name in the prompt is ""VAERS_ID"".
The condition value for this field is not specified in the prompt.
To generate an Elasticsearch query based on the field name and condition value, we would need more information about the desired search results. For example, if we wanted to find all records in the database with a specific VAERS ID, we could use the following query:
```
{
  ""query"": {
    ""term"": {
      ""VAERS_ID"": {
        ""value"": ""XYZ123"",
        ""boost"": 1.0

            }
        }
    },
    ""size"": 10
}
```
Explanation:

The field name in the prompt is ""STATE"", so we will use that as the basis for our Elasticsearch query. The condition value is ""CA"", so we will use a ""term"" query to search for documents where the ""STATE"" field is equal to ""CA"". The ""size"" parameter specifies that we want to retrieve 10 results.

Note that the prompt also mentions other fields, such as ""AGE_YRS"", ""VAERS_ID"", and ""SYMPTOM_TEXT"", but these are not used in the query since they are not specified as condition values. If you want to include these fields in the query,"
1307,"The field name you are looking for is ""AGE_YRS"".

The condition value for ""AGE_YRS"" is 96.0.

Here's the Elasticsearch query to retrieve all records where ""AGE_YRS"" is equal to 96.0:

```
{
  ""query"": {
    ""term"": {
      ""AGE_YRS"": 96.0
    }
  }
}
```

Note that this query will return all records where the value of the ""AGE_YRS"" field is exactly 96.0, without any rounding or truncating. If you want to retrieve records where the value of ""AGE_YRS"" is greater than or equal to 96.0, you can use the ""gte"" operator instead of ""eq"":

```
{
  ""query"": {
    ""term"": {"
1349,"The field name is ""AGE_YRS""
The condition value is 48.0
The Elasticsearch query would be:
""age_yrs"": 48.0

}
}
}
}
```
Explanation:
The above query will retrieve all the documents in the index where the ""SYMPTOM_TEXT"" field has a value greater than or equal to ""08/15/2021"". This will return all the patients who have symptoms starting from 08/15/2021."
3917,"The field name in the prompt is ""SYMPTOM_TEXT"".
The condition value is ""starting from 05/29/2021"".
The Elasticsearch query would be:
```
symptomText:* starting_from:05/29/2021
```
Explanation:
The field name ""SYMPTOM_TEXT"" is specified in the prompt. To extract the specific condition value, we need to identify the keyword ""starting from"" and the date range mentioned after it. In this case, the condition value is ""05/29/2021"".

To generate the Elasticsearch query, we can use the following syntax:
```
symptomText:* starting_from:05/29/2021
```
This query will return all the documents in the index where the ""SYMPTOM_TEXT"""

The field name requested in the prompt is ""AGE_YRS"", so we need to extract the value of this field from the question. The condition value provided is ""39.0"", so we need to generate an Elasticsearch query that matches documents where the value of the ""AGE_YRS"" field is equal to 39.0.

We can use the ""term"" query to achieve this, and specify the field name and value as follows:

{
""term"": {
""AGE_YRS"": {
""value"": 39.0,
""boost"": 1.0"
7718,"The field name is ""ALLERGIES"".

The condition value is ""hydromorphone hcl"".

The Elasticsearch query would be:

""ALLERGIES"": {
""term"": {
""hydromorphone hcl"": {}
}
}

Explanation:

The field name ""ALLERGIES"" is specified in the prompt, and the condition value ""hydromorphone hcl"" is extracted from the question. The Elasticsearch query uses the ""term"" filter to search for documents where the ""ALLERGIES"" field contains the value ""hydromorphone hcl"". The empty curly braces {} indicate that this is a single term filter, and the lack of any other filters or sorting criteria means that the result set will contain all documents where the ""ALLERGIES"" field contains ""hydromorphone hcl"", regardless of any other fields"
7726,"The field name is ""ALLERGIES"".
The condition value is ""erythromycin"".
The Elasticsearch query would be:
```
{
  ""term"": {
    ""ALLERGIES.ERYTHROMYCIN"": {

  }
}
```
This query will return all documents (i.e., vaccine recipients) that have the ""ERYTHROMYCIN"" value set to ""true"" in the ""ALLERGIES"" field."
773,"The field name is AGE_YRS.
The condition value is 89.0.
The Elasticsearch query would be:
```
age_yrs:89.0
```
Explanation:
The field name is AGE_YRS, which is a numerical field representing the patient's age in years. The condition value is 89.0, which is the specific value we want to extract from the dataset. To extract this value, we can use the Elasticsearch query `age_yrs:89.0`, which will return all documents where the value of the AGE_YRS field is equal to 89.0."

Explanation:
The question is asking for the number of vaccine recipients who had an allergic reaction to sumatriptans. To answer this question, we need to extract the ""ALLERGIES"" field name and the ""sumatriptans"" condition value from the question. Then, we can use the extracted information to generate an Elasticsearch query that filters the results based on the specified condition. In this case, the query would filter for documents where the ""allergies"" field has a value of ""sumatriptans""."
7771,"Based on the given prompt, the field name is ""ALLERGIES"".

Explanation:
The field name is ""VAERS_ID"", and the condition value is ""before"". To extract the specific condition value from the question, we need to identify the word ""before"" in the sentence. In this case, the word ""before"" is used to indicate that we should find all records where the value of the ""VAERS_ID"" field is before the current date.

To generate the Elasticsearch query based on the field name and condition value, we can use the term query with the ""VAERS_ID"" field name and the condition value of ""before"". The query will return"

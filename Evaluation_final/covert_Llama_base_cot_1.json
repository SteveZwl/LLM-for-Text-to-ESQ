If so, that's where your infinite loop is happening.\n\nComment: Yes it does @NickWatson\n\nComment: If you have a while loop, why are you trying to do something outside of that while loop? The while loop will just keep running over and over again until it finds a way out (i.e., the code in the body of the loop ends). So if you want to stop the loop, you need to either put a `break` statement inside the while loop or put an `else` statement after it.\n\nComment: I would like to know what the most common disease is from all the clinical notes.

The format of the string is a bit more complex than what is shown here but is similar in concept.\n\nYou can also provide an array of conditions. Each item in the array is handled as if it were a separate question.

The following figure shows how the `QnA` works.\n\n![](..\/images\/qna.","9361":"{\n      \"took\": 159.4273,\n      \"timed_out\": false,\n      \"received\": [\n        {\n          \"_index\": \"vax-es\",\n          \"_type\": \"doc\",\n          \"_id\": \"1\",\n          \"_score\": null,\n          \"_source\": {\n            \"RECVDATE\": \"2021-08-12T19:10:00.000Z\",\n            \"STATE\": \"NY\",\n            \"AGE_YRS\": \"49\",\n            \"VAERS_ID\": \"1557977\",\n            \"SEX\": \"F\",\n            \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\": \"Acute myocarditis\/pericarditis\",\n            \"DIED\": null,\n            \"ER_VISIT\": true,","2518":"{\n        \"took\": 98,\n        \"timed_out\": false,\n        \"_shards\": {\n            \"total\": 5,\n            \"successful\": 5,\n            \"failed\": 0\n        },\n        \"hits\": {\n            \"total\": {\n                \"value\": 1074\n            },\n            \"max_score\": null,\n            \"hits\": [\n                {\n                    \"_index\": \"vaers\",\n                    \"_type\": \"death\",\n                    \"_id\": \"62eec85f-fdc9-49b5-91a2-8be3881efbf8\",\n                    \"_score\": null,\n                    \"fields\": {\n                        \"age_yrs\": 17,\n                        \"recvdate\": \"202","5630":"```json\n{\n    \"took\": {\n        \"buffered_c\": 1234567890\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 1.8.2.2.3 - Patient Name Extraction\n\n**Task:**\nExtract patient name in a given sentence.\n\n**Data Format:**\nThe data format is similar to what we used previously. This time, there are two columns, one of them is the question and the other one is the answer. The question column will have a sentence that contains multiple questions. In each question, there is a name that needs to be extracted.\n\n| Data Set | Dataset Description                                         |\n| :------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| train    | Train dataset with 1000 examples                              |\n| test     | Test dataset with 100 examples                                |\n|","1509":"\"{\n    \\\"query\\\": {\n        \\\"bool\\\": {\n            \\\"must\\\": [\n                {\n                    \\\"range\\\": {\n                        \\\"RECVDATE\\\": {\n                            \\\"gte\\\": \\\"2022-03-16\\\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \\\"term\\\": {\n                        \\\"VAERS_ID\\\": 478975\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \\\"should\\\": [\n                {\n                    \\\"match\\\": {\n                        \\\"SYMPTOM_TEXT\\\": {\n                            \\\"query\\\": \\\"adverse events\\\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \\\"match\\\": {\n                        \\\"LAB_DATA\\\": {\n                            \\\"query\\\": \\\"adverse events\\\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            ]","8048":"```json\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"VAERS_ID\": \"854791\"\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"LAB_DATA.L_THREAT\": \"COVID-19\"\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"@timestamp\": {\n                            \"gte\": \"2013-12-20T00:00:00Z\",\n                            \"lte\": \"2013-12-20T00:00:00Z\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"should\": [\n                {\n                    \"match\": {","2792":"The number of people who died on 10\/24\/2021 is 15679.\n```\n\nTo run the model, you can simply click the Run button at the top right corner of the page or type the following command in your terminal to run the model.\n\n```bash\npython3 -m pytorch_model_zoo.run -m my-covid-vaccine-death-count-predictor\n```\n\n## Performance\n\nWe evaluate our model on test data.

a collection (in your case you will read it in the variable `records`) so that you can do something like:\n\n\\begin{code}\nvar record = records.Find(i => i.VAERS_ID == vaersId);\n\\end{code}\n\nIf you don't do that, you won't be able to use the `find` method because you need a collection type, not a string.\n\n\\strong{Second}: The find method only searches for elements where the given property

So when you try to store it in your map, it will throw an exception because it cannot convert a `String` to a `Map`.\n\nYou need to add some logic to check if the input string is a valid condition or not.

It affects more than half of women during their reproductive years. However, not all fibrocystic breasts are due to FBD. Other conditions such as fat necrosis or inflammatory breast cancer can present with similar clinical findings. In general, any woman who has dense breasts that feel lumpy should see her doctor.

However, there are a few things that can be improved upon in your code. Firstly, when using `df.select()` it is not necessary to create separate variables for each column. Instead, you can just pass all of the column names directly into `df.select()`. Additionally, instead of using `==` to compare strings, you can use `===` which will ensure that the values are actually equal (i.e. not just containing the same text). Lastly, instead of using `df.filter()` you could use `df.loc` or even better, `df.query`. Here is an example of how you might rewrite your code:\n\n```python\n\ndf =","5880":"\"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n        \"should\": [\n            {\n                \"term\": {\n                    \"clinical_notes.keyword\": \"anemia\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"term\": {\n                    \"clinical_notes.keyword\": \"Anemia\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: Thanks for answering! I'm not sure if I understand correctly though. My problem is that there are multiple conditions (for example, I want to find all patients who have a condition of both \"anemia\" and \"blood pressure\") in my database.

If you could help me out I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you in advance!\n\nComment: You need to use a different variable name for each if statement. It doesn't matter what you call them as long as they don't overlap.\n\nComment: Are there any other problems with your code? You have unused variables and unnecessary parentheses around some conditions.\n\nAnswer: The problem is that both the variables named \"isDepressed\" are being assigned to true, which means only the last if statement will be executed.

            select new { q, a };\n\\end{","6741":"{\n    \"took\": 0.492386711534345,\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"filter\": [\n                {\n

The solution uses a list of all possible fields that could contain the symptoms.

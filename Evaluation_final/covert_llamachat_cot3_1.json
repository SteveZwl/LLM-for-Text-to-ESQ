The condition value 'chronic UTI' is the search term we want to extract from the clinical notes. The Elasticsearch query uses the 'term' query to search for documents that contain the specified value in the 'VAERS_ID' field. The 'boost' parameter is set to 1.0 to give the search term a higher relevance score.","7918":"The field name is \"VAERS_ID\"\nThe condition value is \"4\/19\/2021\"\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"term\": {\n\"VAERS_ID\": \"4\/19\/2021\"\n}\n}\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe above query will fetch all the patients who have a VAERS ID of \"4\/19\/2021\".

This will give us all the patients who received both the inactivated poliovirus vaccine and the HPV vaccine (Gardasil).\n\nNote: In the real-world scenario, you would need to modify the query based on the actual field names and values in your database. Additionally, you may need to use more advanced search operators and filters to further narrow down the results based on other criteria such as age range, sex, symptoms, etc.","8371":"The field name is \"VAERS_ID\"\nThe condition value is \"prior to the current vaccine\"\n\nElasticsearch query:\nvaers_id:* prior_to_current_vaccine\n\nExplanation:\nThe above query will search for all records in the Elasticsearch database where the \"VAERS_ID\" field contains any value and the record has a \"prior_to_current_vaccine\" condition. The query uses the wildcard operator \"*\", which matches any string, to search for all possible values in the \"VAERS_ID\" field. The condition \"prior_to_current_vaccine\" is added to the query using the \"must\" clause, which requires that both conditions be true for a record to be returned as a search result.","842":"The field name is \"AGE_YRS\"\nThe condition value is \"67.0\"\nThe Elasticsearch query would be:\n\"age_yrs\": 67.0\n\nNote: The above answer is based on the given prompt and clinical notes.

To create an Elasticsearch query based on this information, we can use the \"term\" query, which searches for documents that contain a specific term (in this case, the condition value \"202200257961\") in a specified field (in this case, \"VAERS_ID\"). The resulting query would be:\n{ \"term\": { \"VAERS_ID\": \"2022","4653":"The field name in the prompt is \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\".\nThe condition value for this field is \"fever\".\nThe Elasticsearch query for this field would be:\n```\n\"symptom_text\": { contains: [\"fever\"] }\n```","2426":"The field name in the prompt is \"DIED\"\nThe condition value for this field is \"on 09\/23\/2021\"\nThe Elasticsearch query based on the field name and condition value would be:\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"DIED\": {\n        \"value\": \"on 09\/23\/2021\",\n        \"boost\": 1.0\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nThis query will return all documents (vaccine recipients) where the \"DIED\" field has a value of \"on 09\/23\/2021\".","9987":"The field name in the prompt is \"VAERS_ID\".\nThe condition value for this field is \"On 02\/22\/2022, how many people have been recorded?\"\nElasticsearch query:\n```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"term\": {\n            \"VAERS_ID\": {\n                \"value\": \"On 02\/22\/2022, how many people have been recorded?\",\n                \"boost\": 1.0\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe field name \"VAERS_ID\" is mentioned in the prompt, and the condition value \"On 02\/22\/2022, how many people have been recorded?\" is a string that needs to be matched exactly. Therefore, we use the \"term\" query with the \"value\" parameter set to the condition value,","4539":"The field name is \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\".\nThe condition value is \"430.0 days\".\nThe Elasticsearch query would be:\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\": {\n        \"value\": \"430.0 days\",\n        \"boost\": 1.0\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","9361":"Field Name: RECVDATE\n\nCondition Value: 2021-02-10\n\nElasticsearch Query: { \"range\": { \"recvdate\": { \"gte\": \"2021-02-10T00:00:00.000Z\", \"lte\": \"2021-02-10T23:59:59.999Z\" } } }\n\nExplanation: The field name is RECVDATE, and the condition value is 2021-02-10. Based on the condition value, we need to extract all the records where the RECVDATE field is greater than or equal to 2021-02-10 and less than or equal to 2021-02-10. To achieve this, we can use the range query in","2518":"The field name is \"DIED\"\nThe condition value is \"Yes\"\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"DIED\": {\n        \"value\": \"Yes\",\n        \"boost\": 1.0\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe above query uses the \"term\" filter to search for documents where the value of the \"DIED\" field is \"Yes\". The \"boost\" parameter sets the boost factor for the filter, which in this case is set to 1.0.","5630":"The field name is \"AGE_YRS\".\nThe condition value is \"75\".\nThe Elasticsearch query would be:\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"AGE_YRS\": 75\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","1509":"The field name is \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\"\nThe condition value is \"Fever\"\n\nElasticsearch query:\n```\n{\n  \"term\": {\n    \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\": \"Fever\"\n  }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe above query uses the \"term\" filter to search for documents where the \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\" field contains the value \"Fever\".","8048":"The field name is \"VAERS_ID\"\nThe condition value is \"12\/20\/2013\"\nElasticsearch query:\n vaers_id:12\/20\/2013\n```\n\nThis answer demonstrates how to identify the field name, extract the condition value, and generate an Elasticsearch query based on the field name and condition value.

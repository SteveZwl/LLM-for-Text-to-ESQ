Clinical notes are a collection of patient data that includes information about their medical history, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. They can be used to help doctors make decisions about what treatments should be given or how they should proceed with care for the patient.\n2. The data in clinical notes is stored in different formats depending on the type of information being recorded (e.g., text vs audio).\n3. In order to extract useful information from these records, it is necessary to convert them into a format that allows easy access by computers so that they can process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently without human intervention.\n4. This conversion process is called Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it involves converting natural language text into structured data using machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks or recurrent neural networks which have been shown to work well at classifying words into categories based on their context within sentences or","9319":"```\nGET

images of code, data, error messages, etc. - copy or type the text itself **into your question** and format it as code (select it and click the `{}` button).

You say you want to \"get the data from one dataset\", but your code shows that you are reading *two* datasets, not one. Why do you think that the first line of your output file is the same as the second line in the input file? Are you asking how to get the count of rows in a table?\n\nComment: @JohnBollinger I am trying to read two datasets, but when I use 'with' clause it reads only one dataset. So, I am not sure if its the right way or not. Yes, I want to get the count of rows in a table. Sorry, I should have been more specific about it.\n\nAnswer: If you want to use a `with` clause, then you need to specify the dataset to be used with the `with`

It occurs when antibodies against one or more of the vaccine components cross-react with the brain tissue causing inflammation in the brain. This results in neurological symptoms such as confusion, weakness, seizures, or coma. Although it is not yet known why some people develop ADEM, there are several theories about what may cause it. One theory suggests that genetic factors play a role because those who have had previous immune system problems are more likely to experience an adverse reaction from a vaccination. Another possibility is that exposure to certain environmental factors like viruses could trigger an autoimmune response leading to the development of ADEM. Furthermore, studies suggest that certain types of medications used during pregnancy may also increase risk for","10602":"```elastic\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\":

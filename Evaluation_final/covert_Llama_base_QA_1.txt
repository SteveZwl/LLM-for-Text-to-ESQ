#### Question 5

Prompt: 
What are the total number of deaths from COVID-19 vaccines in the US?

Answer:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_deaths FROM covid_raw_data;
```

#### Question 6

Prompt: 
How many individuals were reported to have died after receiving a dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine?

Answer:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DIED) AS pfizer_death_count FROM covid"
10700,"[ { ""took"": 3.175992866125, ""from"": 127, ""size"": 263 } ]
```

**Explanation:**

The condition is `vax_lot == '042bela'`.

So the query will be:

`""vax_lot"":""042bela""`

```
[ { ""took"": 3.175992866125, ""from"": 127, ""size"": 263 } ]
```

#### Solution:

The solution code is given below:

```python
def solution(args):
    count = 0
    # Write your code here
    filename = args[0]
    data_file = open(filename,'r')
    for line in data_file:

11438,"Prompt: ### In your project, you have a database with clinical notes for COVID-19 patients. Each note has a title and some text. Given a title, write a function that returns the most common symptom mentioned in the text. For example, if the title was ""COVID patient,"" the most common symptoms would be ""fever"" (8), ""cough"" (5) and ""shortness of breath"" (3). You can assume that all words are lowercase and separated by white space. There may be more than one most common symptom. ##

**Explanation**

In the given clinical note, it can be observed that there are 4 fields mentioned:

- RECVDATE
- STATE
- AGE_YRS
- VAERS_ID

And also a condition:

- STATE = VAERS ID

Hence, we can infer that the value of `STATE` field must match with the value of `VAERS ID` field in order to satisfy the condition. 

Now, since the condition has only one field named `STATE`, hence the filed name would be `STATE`. And the condition value would be `VAERS ID`.

So, if the condition is satisfied then the ElasticSearch query generated would be:

\end{code}

Comment: This question doesn't make any sense to me. You say you want to ""get the data from one dataset"", but your code shows that you are reading *two* datasets, not one. Why do you think that the first line of your output file is the same as the second line in the input file? Are you asking how to get the count of rows in a table?

Comment: @JohnBollinger I am trying to read two datasets, but when I use 'with' clause it reads only one dataset. So, I am not sure if its the right way or not. Yes, I want to get the count of rows in a table. Sorry, I should have been more specific about it.

Answer: If you want to use a `with` clause, then you need to specify the dataset to be used with the `with` keyword:

12963,"Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a rare but serious complication that can occur after receiving certain vaccines. It occurs when antibodies against one or more of the vaccine components cross-react with the brain tissue causing inflammation in the brain. This results in neurological symptoms such as confusion, weakness, seizures, or coma. Although it is not yet known why some people develop ADEM, there are several theories about what may cause it. One theory suggests that genetic factors play a role because those who have had previous immune system problems are more likely to experience an adverse reaction from a vaccination. Another possibility is that exposure to certain environmental factors like viruses could trigger an autoimmune response leading to the development of ADEM. Furthermore, studies suggest that certain types of medications used during pregnancy may also increase risk for"

#### Question 5

In order to identify vaccine side effects such as seizures or heart attack, we need to first search for relevant records. For example, if a patient received Pfizer vaccine on 2022-03-16 and experienced cardiac arrest symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath on 2022-04-08, then the clinical notes for this case should contain both phrases “chest pain”"

Comment: Do you have any code so far? I think it would be easier to write a program that reads your text file into a dictionary, then uses the `get` method on the dictionary to find the key that matches the input string.

Comment: You can use a loop to read each line in your file. For example, `for line in open('yourfile.txt', 'r') as f: print(f)` will print every line. If you want to store that data into a dictionary, check out the `dict()` constructor function: https://www.w3schools.com/python/func_dict_dict.asp

Comment: Please add the code that you've tried so far.

Answer: I assume you are looking for something like this:

### Question 2

#### Prompt:

**Question:** In a clinical study of patients who have received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, researchers are interested in exploring whether there is any association between the vaccine type (Pfizer vs Moderna) and age. For example, they want to know if there are more hospitalizations among those who received Pfizer than among those who received Moderna. They also want to compare the rate of hospitalizations between those who were younger than 50 years old and those older than 50 years old.

I want to extract the value of the first question (i.e. ""What is the filed name?""), then use that value in the second question (""What is the condition value for this field?"").

The issue is that I am not able to get the value of the first question using the ""extract"" function. I'm sure it has something to do with how I've defined my regex but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

**_Question:_** Write the code to find how many patients were hospitalized after vaccination.

##### _Answer Explanation_

df = pd.read_csv('VAERS_Data_CSV/VAERS_Raw_Data.csv')

print(df)

# Code starts here

Prompt: ### Elasticsearch database with field names:

I am trying to use the Prompt function in Excel but I keep getting error when I run it. Please help.

Comment: You should probably show us what you're doing and how it fails rather than just asking for someone to write code for you. This is not a free coding service, and if you don't provide any information about your attempt we can only guess at what the problem might be.

Comment: I have added more details to the post. Please let me know if you need anything else from me. Thanks.

Comment: I am using Prompt() function in Excel as shown in the image above. But when I run it, it shows ""Error 1004"".

Comment: That is very unhelpful. Please show us the code that you are running. The screenshot shows that you've used the prompt function to define a variable, but we have no idea what you'"

Comment: Hi! Please edit your question and add the code you have already written. It's difficult to help when we don't know what you've done so far.

# Step-by-step explanation of how you solved each question.

1.  I used a combination of df and read_csv to get the data in the correct format and then I used group by to get the count of patients for each symptom.
2.  To extract the vaccine manufacturer, I first used the str method to convert it into a string and then I used the find function to extract just the manufacturer part of the string.
3.  I used the filter function to only pull out the records that have an age greater than 50 years old.
4.  I used the str method again but instead of getting the manufacturer as a string, I got the state abbreviation as a string. Then I used the find function again to extract just the state abbreviation part of the string.
5.  I used the split function to separate the text symptom column"

2. The data in clinical notes is stored in different formats depending on the type of information being recorded (e.g., text vs audio).
3. In order to extract useful information from these records, it is necessary to convert them into a format that allows easy access by computers so that they can process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently without human intervention.
4. This conversion process is called Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it involves converting natural language text into structured data using machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks or recurrent neural networks which have been shown to work well at classifying words into categories based on their context within sentences or"

Answer:"
7474,"\end{code}

I know I need to use the condition for my logic but I'm not sure how to get it working.

Comment: Please do not share images of code, data, error messages, etc. - copy or type the text itself **into your question** and format it as code (select it and click the `{}` button). That will make it searchable for more people and easier to read/understand. If you share images of code/data then other users can't even try it. Images are great for things like diagrams, but should not be used for textual content. See [ask].

Comment: This sounds like a homework problem. You don't have enough information in your post to give you much help. Where does the information come from? Is there a dataset?

Answer: As per your question, we need to extract the condition value for the ""STATE"" column that equals"

I am trying to figure out how to write a code that would search for a certain key-value pair in the text file, if it exists then I want to return the value of that key-value pair from the text file. For example, in the above case, I want to find the value for the key-value pair ""VAERS_ID"". So far I have tried to use regex but haven't been able to make much progress. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Comment: Can you please share what you have tried so far? We are more than willing to help but we need some idea as to which direction you are heading towards

Answer: You can use `grep` to search for a specific keyword in a text file. It returns all lines containing that keyword.

\begin{code}
$ grep -i ""VAERS_ID"" /path/to/textfile

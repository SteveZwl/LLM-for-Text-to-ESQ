For example, to retrieve all records from a certain date range (e.g., January 15th to January 31st), we can use the following query:\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"range\": {\n      \"RECVDATE\": {\n        \"gte\":","9382":"```\n{\n   \"query\": {\n      \"bool\": {\n         \"filter\": [\n            {\n               \"term\": {\n                  \"VAERS_ID\": \"USPFIZER INC202101064027\"\n               }\n            }\n         ]\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe above query is a Boolean query that filters the search results based on the \"VAERS_ID\" field. The filter is applied using the \"term\" query operator, which returns documents where the specified term is present in the field. In this case, we are looking for documents where the \"VAERS_ID\" field contains the value \"USPFIZER INC202101064027\".\n\nNote that the query does not use any aggregations or sorting, so it will return a list of all documents that","536":"Elasticsearch Query:\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"term\": {\n\"STATE\": \"PA\"\n}\n},\n\"_source\": [\"RECVDATE\", \"STATE\", \"AGE_YRS\", \"VAERS_ID\", \"SEX\", \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\", \"DIED\", \"ER_VISIT\", \"L_THREAT\", \"HOSPITAL\", \"HOSPDAYS\", \"DISABLE\", \"VAX_DATE\", \"LAB_DATA\", \"OTHER_MEDS\", \"CUR_ILL\", \"HISTORY\", \"PRIOR_VAX\", \"TODAYS_DATE\", \"OFC_VISIT\", \"VAX_TYPE\", \"VAX_MANU\", \"VAX_LOT\", \"VAX_DOSE_SERIES\", \"VAX_NAME\", \"ALLERGIES\"]\n}\n}\n\nEx","8077":"```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"filter\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": {\n            \"RECVDATE\": \"2021-03-09\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"VAERS_ID\": \"any\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe above query uses the `bool` query and filters the results based on two conditions:\n\n1.

The patient's state must be \"lymphedema\". This is specified using a term filter.\n2. The patient must have at least one diagnosis of diabetes.

The `value` parameter specifies the value to match, and the `operator` parameter specifies the comparison operator to use. In this case, we're using the `=` operator to match exactly 92.0 years.\n\nAny patient with an `AGE_YRS` value of 92.0 will be returned in the search results.","3811":"```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"filter\": [\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"recvdate\": {\"gte\": \"2021-10-16\"}}\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe query uses the `bool` query and sets up a filter using the `range` filter. The `range` filter specifies that we only want to return documents where the `recvdate` field is greater than or equal to October 16, 2021.\n\nThe `bool` query also allows us to specify multiple filters, so if we wanted to filter by other fields as well (e.g., `state`, `age_yrs`, etc.), we could add additional filters to the `bool` query.","10609":"```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"must\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": {\n            \"RECVDATE\": {\n              \"value\": \"#EW0191\"\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\": {\n              \"query\": \"vaccine\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"filter\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": {\n            \"VAERS_ID\": {\n              \"value\": \"#EW0191\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe given clinical notes are asking for all patients who received a vaccine from #EW0191.

The `match` query is used to search for documents that contain a specific value in a specified field. In this case, we are searching for documents where the value of the \"allergies.natural_rubber\" field is \"true\".

The `match` query is used to search for documents that contain a specific term or phrase, and the `exists` operator is used to check if the term exists in the document. In this case, we are looking for notes that contain the word \"ctscanhead\" anywhere in the text.\n\nYou can also use the `term` query instead of `match` to search for exact phrases. For example:\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"STAGE\": \"ctscanhead","2438":"Elasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"filter\": [\n                {\n                    \"term\": {\n                        \"RECVDATE\": \"2021-12-31\"\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"STATE\": \"deceased\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe above Elasticsearch query uses the `bool` query type to specify a set of filters that must be true for a document to be considered a match. The first filter is a `term` filter that matches documents where the `RECVDATE` field is equal to \"2021-12-31\".

The term filter is used to search for the exact word \"PVC\" in the allergies field. The must clause is used to ensure that the patient has a record in the RECVDATE field. The * in the query represents any date.","10466":"Elasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"STATE\": {\n        \"value\": \"approved\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"term\": {\n          \"VAERS_ID\": {\n            \"value\": \"GLAXOSMITHKLINE BIOLOGICALS\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe above query uses the `term` query to search for documents where the value of the `STATE` field is \"approved\". It then uses a `filtered` query to filter out any documents that do not have the specified value in the `VAERS_ID` field. The `filter` query uses a `term` query to match only documents with the exact value \"GLAXOS","1109":"Elasticsearch Query:\n\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"term\": {\n\"AGE_YRS\": \"100\"\n}\n},\n\"size\": 100\n}\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe above query will return all the documents from the index where the value of the \"AGE_YRS\" field is exactly equal to 100. The \"size\" parameter specifies that we want to retrieve 100 documents.\n\nNote: The field names in the query match the field names in the provided list of fields.","7771":"The Elasticsearch query for the given clinical notes would be:\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"filter\": [\n        { \"term\": { \"STATE\": \"VA\" }},\n        { \"term\": { \"ALLERGIES\": \"insect\" } }\n      ],\n      \"must\": [\n        { \"match\": { \"HOSPITAL\": \"Yes\" } },\n        { \"match\": { \"LAB_DATA\": \"Yes\" } }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. The query starts with a `bool` query which allows us to specify multiple filters and must clauses.\n2. The first filter is a `term` filter on the `STATE` field with the value \"VA\".

To achieve this, we need to filter the search results based on the'recvdate' field and the'state' field. The'recvdate' field should have a value greater than or equal to now minus 30 days (to filter out the recent records). Additionally, we should only consider the patients who have an active state.\n\nTo accomplish this, we can use the '"}}

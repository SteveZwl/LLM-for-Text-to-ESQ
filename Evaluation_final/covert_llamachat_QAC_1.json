The prompt is related to a patient's medical history and symptoms, so we can infer that the field name is likely to be \"recvdate\" (receive date), which is a common field in medical databases to store the date when a patient received a treatment or medication.\n\nBased on the condition value provided in the prompt, we can see that it is \"todays date\", so we can infer that the condition value for this field is \"now\". Therefore, the Elasticsearch query for this field would be:\n```\n{\n\"query","6455":"Field Name: HOSPITAL\nCondition Value: YES\nElasticsearch Query: {term: {HOSPITAL:YES}}","9612":"The field name is RECVDATE.\nThe condition value is 202101495427.\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"term\": {\n\"RECVDATE\": \"202101495427\"\n}\n}\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe filed name is RECVDATE, and the condition value is 202101495427. To generate the Elasticsearch query, we need to enclose the condition value in double quotes so that it can be treated as a string. Then, we use the term query to search for documents where the RECVDATE field matches the given value.","12755":"Field Name: symptom_text\nCondition Value: Erythema multiforme\nElasticsearch Query: symptom_text:erythema multiforme\n\nJustification:\nThe field name is \"symptom_text\" because it is mentioned in the prompt as one of the fields in the Elasticsearch database. The condition value is \"Erythema multiforme\" because it is specified in the prompt as the condition to search for. Therefore, the Elasticsearch query would be \"symptom_text:erythema multiforme\".","4656":"Field Name: VAX_DATE\nCondition Value: 494.0\nElasticsearch Query:\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"range\": {\n\"VAX_DATE\": {\n\"gte\": \"2022-01-01\",\n\"lte\": \"2023-01-01\"\n}\n}\n},\n\"size\": 10\n}","933":"Field Name: AGE_YRS\nCondition Value: 76.0\nElasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"term\": {\n\"AGE_YRS\": 76.0\n}\n}\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe field name requested in the prompt is \"AGE_YRS\", so we will use the \"term\" query to search for documents where the value of the \"AGE_YRS\" field is exactly equal to 76.0.","12130":"Field Name: VAX_TYPE\nCondition Value: PNEUMO (VAXNEUVANCE)\nElasticsearch Query:\nvax_type:PNEUMO (VAXNEUVANCE) AND RECVDATE:[insert date range here]\n\nExplanation:\nThe field name is \"VAX_TYPE\" and the condition value is \"PNEUMO (VAXNEUVANCE)\". To generate an Elasticsearch query based on this field and condition value, we can use the following query:\n\nvax_type:PNEUMO (VAXNEUVANCE) AND RECVDATE:[insert date range here]\n\nThis query will return all documents in the index where the \"VAX_TYPE\" field is equal to \"PNEUMO (VAXNEUVANCE)\" and the \"RECVDATE\" field falls within the specified date range.","7237":"The field name is 'VAERS_ID'\nThe condition value is '[ ]'\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"VAERS_ID\": \"[condition value]\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nNote: Please replace `[condition value]` with the actual condition value you want to search for in the Elasticsearch database.","5072":"Field Name: allergies\nCondition Value: None\nElasticsearch Query: allergies:[] \nExplanation: The field name is \"allergies\" and the condition value is \"None\". Therefore, the Elasticsearch query would be \"allergies:[]\" to search for records where the \"allergies\" field is empty or missing.","183":"Filed Name: RECVDATE\nCondition Value: 01\/23\/2022\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"term\": {\n            \"RECVDATE\": {\n                \"value\": \"01\/23\/2022\",\n                \"boost\": 1.0\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```","1835":"Filed Name: MYOGLOBIN\nCondition Value: AFTER VACCINATION\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n\nmyoglobin:AFTER VACCINATION\n\nExplanation:\nThe filed name is \"MYOGLOBIN\" and the condition value is \"AFTER VACCINATION\". Based on this information, we can generate an Elasticsearch query that retrieves all records from the database where the \"MYOGLOBIN\" field has a value of \"AFTER VACCINATION\".","1820":"The filed name is \"PROSTATE_INFECTION\".\nThe condition value for this field is \"AFTER_VACCINATION\".\nElasticsearch query:\n```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                { \"term\": { \"PROSTATE_INFECTION\": \"AFTER_VACCINATION\" } }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe filed name \"PROSTATE_INFECTION\" is identified from the prompt as the field name that contains the information about prostate infection. The condition value \"AFTER_VACCINATION\" is also identified from the prompt as the specific condition value that needs to be extracted.\nBased on the field name and condition value, an Elasticsearch query is generated using the \"bool\" query with a \"must\" clause that filters for documents","12653":"Field Name: Cytomegalovirus test negative\n\nCondition Value: Associated with the vaccination\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"Cytomegalovirus test negative\": {\n        \"value\": \"Associated with the vaccination\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","5056":"Filed Name: VAX_DATE\nCondition Value: Today's Date\nElasticsearch Query:\n{ \"query\": { \"term\": { \"VAX_DATE\": { \"value\": \"2023-03-06\", \"boost\": 1.0 } } } }\n\nExplanation:\nThe field name requested in the question is \"VAX_DATE\". The condition value provided is \"Today's Date\". Therefore, the Elasticsearch query should search for documents where the \"VAX_DATE\" field is equal to today's date (03\/06\/2023). The query uses the \"term\" query type with a \"value\" parameter set to today's date, and a \"boost\" parameter set to 1.0 to give a boost to the query.","11438":"Field Name: VAX_TYPE\nCondition Value: MMR\nElasticsearch Query:\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"term\": {\n\"VAX_TYPE\": {\n\"value\": \"MMR\",\n\"boost\": 1.0\n}\n}\n}\n}","10769":"Field Name: VAX_NAME\nCondition Value: FJ1619\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"term\": {\n\"VAX_NAME\": \"FJ1619\"\n}\n}\n}","7332":"Filed Name: ALLERGIES\nCondition Value: PVC\nElasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"term\": {\n\"ALLERGIES\": \"PVC\"\n}\n}\n}\n```","10466":"Field Name: VAERS_ID\nCondition Value: [ ]\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"term\": {\n\"VAERS_ID\": [insert_condition_value_here]\n}\n}\n}\n```\nNote: The above query will retrieve all documents in the Elasticsearch database where the field \"VAERS_ID\" matches the condition value provided in the prompt.","1109":"Filed Name: AGE_YRS\nCondition Value: 100.0\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n{\n\"query\": {\n\"term\": {\n\"AGE_YRS\": {\n\"value\": 100.0,\n\"boost\": 1.0\n}\n}\n}\n}","7771":"Field Name: ALLERGIES\nCondition Value: insect\nElasticsearch Query:\nALLERGIES:insect\n\nNote: The above query will return all the documents in the index where the field \"ALLERGIES\" contains the value \"insect\".","1378":"Filed Name: RECVDATE\nCondition Value: 0.3\n\nElasticsearch Query:\n```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"term\": {\n            \"RECVDATE\": {\n                \"value\": \"0.3\",\n                \"boost\": 1.0\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nThe field name is RECVDATE, and the condition value is 0.3. Based on this information, we can generate an Elasticsearch query that retrieves all documents (patients) where the RECVDATE field has a value of 0.3. The query uses the term filter to match only documents with a RECVDATE value of 0.3. The boost parameter is set to 1.0 to give the filter a default boost of 1.0."}}

However, each year, about 5,000 Americans receive post-exposure prophylaxis, a series of rabies vaccinations after possible exposure to a rabid animal. There were 68 cases of human rabies reported to CDC during 2019–2021, but this likely underestimates the true number of cases. During 2019–2021, two persons died after being infected with rabies; both cases occurred outside the United States.

Answer:"
10355,"### [How many vaccine recipients got UNK? which TTOX is the most popular for people?]
###The question asks how many vaccine recipients have the value of UNK in the field of STATE. We need to build a query that will return the count of the number of records that contain this value. For this we need to use aggregation queries.
###First create the aggregation query by creating a sum aggregation function and passing it the field name (STATE) and the value (UNK). Then add the aggregation query to our Elasticsearch POST template.
###Finally run the query.

11442,"RA is a very common autoimmune disease, so there is no specific vaccine that can be used to prevent it.
However, some people may benefit from getting certain vaccines. For example, the flu vaccine can help reduce the risk of developing complications from RA, such as pneumonia.
In addition, the hepatitis B vaccine may be recommended for people with RA who have other risk factors for hepatitis B infection.
Finally, the tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (TDAP) vaccine may be recommended for pregnant women with RA, as this vaccine can protect both the mother and baby against serious diseases.

12218,"# [{""name"":""HEP A (HAVRIX)"",""count"":86}]
###The clinical notes contains a list of HEP A (HAVRIX) vaccines along with their count. Here, we need to find out the name of the most popular vaccine by counting the number of times each vaccine appears in the list. The output is a list of the vaccine name and its count.

To build a query that will return the required result, we can use the “size” aggregation function. This function will return the total count of each element in the list. Then, we can sort the results based on this aggregated value using the “sort” function. We can also limit the number of elements returned by the query by specifying the “size” option.

- The question is asking to find out if there is any correlation between increased interleukin levels and receiving a COVID-19 vaccination.

- The user can enter a date range in the format MM/DD/YYYY and the answer will be returned for that time period.

- In the answer section, there are two lists of patients: one list has patients who had an increase in interleukin levels after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, while the other list contains patients who did not experience this increase in interleukin levels.

- Both lists include the following patient data:

- Patient ID

- Date of vaccination

- Gender

- Age in years

- Symptoms experienced by the patient

- Whether the patient was admitted to hospital

- Number of days spent in hospital

- If the patient"

The development of a pharyngeal cyst may be related to a previous infection or injury, but it is unlikely to be directly caused by a vaccine. It is also worth mentioning that some people may develop a swollen lymph node near the site of the injection, which is known as lymphadenopathy, but this does not necessarily indicate the presence of a cyst.
It's important to keep in mind that vaccinations are safe and effective ways to prevent serious diseases, and the benefits far outweigh the potential risks. If you have concerns about a vaccine or its side effects, it's best to speak"

###To extract specific text from the clinical notes, we could use regular expressions to match specific patterns in the text. For example, to find all instances of “carbon dioxide” in the clinical notes, we could use a regex like this:
#GET /{patient-id}/_search?q={""regexp"":{""body"":""Carbon dioxide""}}
###This will return all documents where the word “carbon dioxide” appears anywhere in the body of the clinical note. We can then iterate over the results and print out any matches that we find.

#### Q6. 

**Hint:** You can use [Kibana Query Language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/query-dsl.html) to filter out documents based on multiple fields in the same query. For example, you can write a query like `state = ""VA"" AND sex = ""M""` to retrieve documents that contain both these two fields with the respective values. 

In this question, we need to find all the VAERS records which have a value of `HOSPDAYS` greater than or equal to 1, while also having a value of `STATE` equal to `""VA""`.

This is how"

To generate the Elasticsearch query for the question, first we need to get an Elasticsearch POST search template.For example question: Give me all the patients whose information are received on 04/13/2022.

###Then identify the filed names, condition values and key clauses (such as ’must’, ’should’, or ’must not’) from the question to populate
the template.

### Finally, substitute the values in the template and use curl to send the request to the server.

The second library we use is 'botocore' which is a low-level client library for AWS. The last library we use is 'aws_signature_v4' which is used to sign requests with AWS credentials.

The next step is to set up our environment variables. We do this by setting the AWS region, access key ID, secret access key, and session token. Once these are set, we can move on to creating the index.

We create an index called 'covid' with one type called 'patient'. This type has two fields - 'name' and 'age'. After creating the index, we create a document called 'Bob' with the following properties: name = Bob; age = 50."

This is a sample code that uses Elasticsearch as a backend service to store data and provide answers to questions about vaccine adverse events based on CDC VAERS data.

The code above shows how you can use a simple and powerful language like Mustache to construct the complex queries in Elasticsearch.

6568,"Explanation:
### Muscle weakness is a common symptom of COVID-19, but it can also be caused by many other conditions. For example, it can be caused by injuries to nerves that control movement or by certain medications such as statins or antidepressants. It is important to see your doctor if you experience any type of weakness so they can determine what might be causing it.
### The answer given above is incorrect because muscle weakness in COVID-19 patients has been reported by multiple studies. In addition, muscle weakness can occur due to other causes such as injuries to nerves controlling movement or certain medications like statins and antidepressants. Therefore, there is no evidence suggesting that muscle atrophy would be more prevalent than muscle weakness in COVID-19 patients.

#### Disease name: Myocardial Infarction

Disease description: This is a heart attack in which the blood supply to part of the heart muscle is suddenly blocked, usually by a buildup of plaque in the arteries leading to the heart. The plaque can rupture, causing a clot to form on its surface. If the clot grows large enough, it can block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle, damaging or killing some heart cells. Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack may lead to heart failure.

- I would use a wildcard in the query to match any patient who has a reaction after vaccination. This will be helpful when I am searching for any adverse reactions that might occur post-vaccine administration.

##### 14. What is the difference between the `term` and `phrase` queries in ElasticSearch?
- The term query is used to find exact matching of terms, while phrase query is used to search for a combination of words within a sentence.

##### 15. Explain how you would implement a `bool` query in Elasticsearch.
- The bool query is used to combine multiple boolean expressions into a single query. It allows us to combine different types of queries together, such as AND"

7879,"#### 2.1.3.19 - [ElasticSearch] Given a set of ElasticSearch queries, write a program that generates a SQL query to retrieve similar results.

**Description**: We will be given a set of Elasticsearch queries and have to return the equivalent SQL query. The SQL query should include the same fields as the Elasticsearch query.

**Input Format**: The first line contains the number of test cases T. Then each test case consists of N lines, where the i-th line is the query Qi which is an Elasticsearch query.

**Constraints**:
- 1 <= T <= 100
- 1 <= Qi <= 100

**Output Format**: For each test case, output one line containing the generated SQL query.

**Sample Input**: 2

This means that you need to access it using the dot notation. In other words, you should use `data['vax_type']`.

You say \"I need to make it so that only one entry can be submitted at a time\". But your code shows that multiple entries will be accepted and then the answer returned. Is this correct? If not, what should happen instead? Also, why does it have to be done in python? It seems like it could easily be done using something like an HTML form (and even if you want to use Python, there are many ways to submit data from a web page to a server).\n\nComment: @Barmar Yes, sorry I was just testing out my idea for how to get this working, but yes it should only accept one entry at a time. I wanted to learn how to do this with python because it would be good practice for me, as I am planning on learning python soon.

share a sample of your data?\n\nComment: The `How many patients were hospitalized for 17.0 days.` is not a valid ES query. You can't do math on dates in an ES query.

Given a relational database table named `test` that contains two columns `name` and `state`, return the rows where the state column contains the string \"NY\".\n2. Given a relational database table named `test` that contains three columns `name`, `state","7533":"```elasticsearch\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"term\": {\n                        \"VAERS_ID\": \"20218564\"\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"term\": {\n                        \"ALLERGIES\": \"nut allergy\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"should\": [\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"CURRENT_ILLNESS\": \"COVID-19\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```","11442":"```elastic\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"must\": [\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"clinical_notes\": \"RA\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"state\": \"active\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"should\": [\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"clinical_notes\": \"Arthritis\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"range\": {\n          \"@timestamp\": {\n            \"gt\": \"2019-11-06T00:00:00Z\",\n            \"lt\": \"2020-01-04T00:00:00Z\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }","6680":"# This is a sample document from the clinical notes corpus.

Or are you asking how to use Elasticsearch to perform a search query on the data in your index?\n\nComment: @Val Hi Val, thank you for replying. I'm asking how to create an elasticsearch index. Thank you!\n\nComment: You can just use the [official documentation](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/guide\/en\/elasticsearch\/reference\/current\/index.html). It explains everything you need to know.\n\nAnswer: In general, there are two approaches that people take when they want to start using Elasticsearch.

What is the frequency of a given symptom across different age ranges?\n\nThe goal here is to find out how many people within each age group have experienced a specific symptom (i.e., the frequency of that symptom in each age range). For example, if we want to know the frequency of \u201cheadache\u201d among children ages 0-4, we would look at the number of cases where the `AGE_YRS` value was between 0 and 4 and the `SYMPTOM_TEXT` value was \u201cheadache\u201d. Then, we would divide this","3679":"{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"@timestamp\": {\n                            \"gte\": \"2021-06-05\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"term\": {\n                        \"STATE\": \"VAERS_ID\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"should\": [\n                {\n                    \"multi_match\": {\n                        \"query\": \"adverse event\",\n                        \"type\": \"phrase\",\n                        \"fields\": [\n                            \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\",\n                            \"CUR_ILL\",\n                            \"HISTORY\",\n                            \"PRIOR_VAX\",\n                            \"OTHER_MEDS\",\n                            \"LAB_DATA\"","1873":"{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"filter\": [\n        {\n          \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n              {\n                \"match\": {\n                  \"VAERS_ID\": {\n                    \"query\": \"VAERS ID\"\n                  }\n                }\n              },\n              {\n                \"bool\": {\n                  \"should\": [\n                    {\n                      \"term\": {\n                        \"VAERS_ID\": \"VAERS ID\"\n                      }\n                    },\n                    {\n                      \"term\": {\n                        \"VAERS_ID\": \"VAERS ID\"\n                      }\n                    },\n                    {\n                      \"term\": {\n                        \"VAERS_ID\": \"VAERS ID\"\n                      }\n                    }\n                  ]\n                }\n              },","7037":"Total number of patients: 36\n```\n\n## Questions\n\n- **Q1.** The `vax_lot` field is missing for some records.

Explanation:
To answer the question, we need to identify the field name that corresponds to the condition value provided in the prompt. In this case, the field name is ""SYMPTOM_TEXT"" because it contains the condition value ""TETANUS DIPHTHERIA"".

Next, we need to generate an Elasticsearch query based on the identified field name and condition value. The query should filter the search results to only include documents where the ""SYMPTOM_TEXT"" field contains the value ""TETANUS DIPHTHERIA"".

The final Elasticsearch query will be:

Explanation:
In the given prompt, the field name is ""VAX_TYPE"", and the condition value is ""[flu]"". Therefore, the Elasticsearch query should be:

Explanation:
The field name requested in the prompt is ""VAX_DATE"". To generate an Elasticsearch query based on this field name and the condition value provided, we need to use the ""term"" query type with the field name and the specified condition value. Therefore, the Elasticsearch query will be:

}
}
}

Explanation:
The field name requested in the prompt is ""VAERS_ID"". To retrieve the number of patients who received vaccines on 03/01/2022, we need to use the ""term"" query operator with the ""VAERS_ID"" field name and the specified condition value. The Elasticsearch query will return all documents (patient records) where the ""VAERS_ID"" field matches the specified value."

Justification:
The field name is SYMPTOM_TEXT because it is mentioned in the prompt as one of the fields in the Elasticsearch database.
The condition value is DIED because it is specified in the prompt as the value that needs to be extracted from the SYMPTOM_TEXT field.
Therefore, the Elasticsearch query would be symptom_text:DIED, which will return all the records from the database where the value of the SYMPTOM_TEXT field is DIED."

Explanation:
The field name is ""SYMPTOM_TEXT"" and the condition value is ""Start with 02/09/2021"". To extract the specific condition values from the question, we need to identify the keyword ""Start"" and the date ""02/09/2021"".

Therefore, the Elasticsearch query should look for records where the RECVDATE field falls within the range of 12/11/2021. To do this, we use the “range” operator in the query, specifying the start and end dates as [“12/11/2021”, “12/11/2021”].

}
```
Explanation:
The field name is ONSET_DATE, and the condition value is 07/01/2018. To retrieve all the cases where the onset date is equal to 07/01/2018, we can use a term query with the ONSET_DATE field and the specified value. The boost parameter is set to 1.0 to give the query a higher ranking in the search results."

Condition Value: Onset Date of Adverse Event Symptom is 11/30/2013
Elasticsearch Query:
{“term”:{“symptom_text”:[“Onset Date of Adverse Event Symptom is 11/30/2013”]}}

Explanation:
The field name is “Symptom Text”. The condition value is “Onset Date of Adverse Event Symptom is 11/30/2013”. Based on this information, we can generate an Elasticsearch query using the “term” filter to search for documents where the “symptom_text” field contains the specified condition value. In this case, the query would be {“term”:{“symptom_text”:[“Onset Date of Adverse Event Symptom is 11/"

Explanation:
In this question, we are asked to identify the field name and condition value for a given prompt. The prompt is related to a patient's medical history and symptoms, so we can infer that the field name is likely to be ""recvdate"" (receive date), which is a common field in medical databases to store the date when a patient received a treatment or medication.

Based on the condition value provided in the prompt, we can see that it is ""todays date"", so we can infer that the condition value for this field is ""now"". Therefore, the Elasticsearch query for this field would be:
```

Explanation:
The field name is RECVDATE, and the condition value is Today's Date. To generate the Elasticsearch query based on this field and condition value, we can use the ""term"" query with the field name RECVDATE and the value set to Today's Date. This will return all documents where the RECVDATE field contains today's date."
7128,"Field Name: symptom_text
Condition Value: dry heaves
Elasticsearch Query: symptom_text:dry heaves

Explanation:

```
Explanation:
The field name is ""Recvdate"". The condition value is ""Today's date"", which means we want to find all records where the ""Recvdate"" field is greater than or equal to today's date.

To generate the Elasticsearch query, we can use the following syntax:
```
{
""query"": {
""term"": {
""fieldname"": {""condition""}}
}
}
```
Here, ""fieldname"" is the name of the field we want to search, and ""condition"" is the condition we want to apply to that field. In this case, the field name is ""Recvdate"""

Elasticsearch Query:
{ ""term"" : { ""VAX_DATE"" : ""02/18/2021"" }}

Explanation:
The field name requested in the question is ""VAX_DATE"". To generate an Elasticsearch query based on this field, we need to specify the condition value as well. In this case, the condition value provided in the question is ""02/18/2021"", so our query will be a term filter that matches only documents where the ""VAX_DATE"" field is equal to ""02/18/2021""."

This allows for a searchable index, so that users can search for relevant information in patient records, e.g., 'patient died from anaphylaxis'. The result is also being fed into the Natural Language Generation (NLG) pipeline to generate reports and notifications automatically, without human intervention. The output of the NLG pipeline could be sent to stakeholders, such as doctors, and used as a knowledge base for further research and analysis.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nA customized data processor was created to process raw clinical notes with high accuracy. A simple pipeline was constructed to demonstrate the potential of a machine learning solution for clinical trials.

We achieved an AUC of.786. Our main goal was not to build the best model but rather to build a model that could be used for future studies to analyze vaccine side effects. We decided to use random forest due to the nature of our data which is unbalanced, with a small number of positive cases. With this type of data, we recommend using a boosting algorithm such as Random Forest.

In these cases, there will be signs and symptoms of fever, headache, neck stiffness, altered mental status, seizures, visual disturbances, weakness, paralysis, dysarthria, aphasia, ataxia, numbness or tingling, tremors, and sensory loss.\\n\\n---\\n# Step', '10602': '```\\n{\\n    \"took\": {\\n        \"total\": 13.4,\\n        \"name\": \"elasticsearch/7.9.3\",\\n        \"version\": null\\n

The NLP API can recognize the meaning of words in text. It uses machine learning models to analyze text, understand its context, and return structured data. This data includes entities, such as people, organizations, locations, concepts, or events, along with their relationships to each other and the broader context of the text. For this exercise, you\u2019ll use the Google Cloud Natural Language API to help users identify the most common symptoms associated with COVID-19. You\u2019ll also create a UI that allows users to enter additional free-form text that is","6452":"1. '[{\"entity\":\"Pulmonary\",\"condition\":[\"has\"]}]'\n2.

These extracted keywords will be used to perform a query search on PubMed (https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/). PubMed contains about 30 million biomedical literature.\nFor example, consider the below statement:\n\u201cThe patient was administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) on January 18, 2021.\u201d\nHere we can extract the keyword 'vaccine', 'Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine', 'BNT162b2'. We can use these keywords as input to search for relevant papers published on PubMed.\n\nExample:\nInput: Clinical Note: 'The patient was administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vacc","11134":"How many people have been injected from ID 28957365?\n'''\n\nfrom pprint import pprint\nfrom datetime import date\nimport re\n\ndef get_age(string):\n    age = 0\n    if string == '':\n        return 0\n    age_text = re.findall(r'\\d+', string)\n    for item in age_text:\n        try:\n            age += int(item)\n        except ValueError as e:\n            pass\n    return age\n\n\nclass EntityClassifier():\n    \"\"\"\n    This class will be used to extract data from a given input text.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.entity_name_mapping = {\n            \"RECVDATE\": \"date\",\n            \"STATE\": \"state\",\n            \"AGE_YRS\": \"age\",\n            \"","1506":"{\"query\": {\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"recdate\":{\"gte\":\"2022-01-19T00:00:00Z\"}}},{\"term\":{\"form_status\":{\"value\":\"completed\"}}}]}}\n\n'''\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Optional\n\nclass Question(BaseModel):\n    question: str\n    answer: List[str] = None\n\n    @validator('answer')\n    def add_comma(cls, v):\n        if len(v) > 0:\n            v = \", \".join(v)\n        return v\n\n\n# -----------------------------------------------------\n#                         INPUT\n# -----------------------------------------------------\ndef get_input():\n    \"\"\"Get raw_input from user\"\"\"\n    print(\"Please enter your input:\")\n    return input","49":"{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"@timestamp\": {\n                            \"gte\": \"2022-03-11T00:00:00Z\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"term\": {\n                        \"receivedDate\": \"2022-03-11\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```","11644":"https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/guide\/en\/elasticsearch\/reference\/current\/query-dsl-bool-query.html#_boolean_query_syntax\nhttps:\/\/www.elastic.co\/guide\/en\/elasticsearch\/reference\/current\/query-dsl-match-query.html\nhttps:\/\/www.elastic.co\/guide\/en\/elasticsearch\/reference\/current\/query-dsl-range-query.html\nhttps:\/\/www.elastic.co\/guide\/en\/elasticsearch\/reference\/current\/query-dsl-term-query.html\n\nCovert the above queries to Elasticsearch queries:\n\n1.\nhttps:\/\/www.elastic.co\/guide\/en\/elasticsearch\/reference\/current\/query-dsl-match-query.html\n\n2.\nhttps:\/\/www.elastic.co\/guide\/en\/elasticsearch\/reference","11205":"```json\n{\n    \"took\": 0.2769,\n    \"timed_out\": false,\n    \"_shards\": {\n        \"total\": 2,\n        \"successful\": 2,\n        \"failed\": 0\n    },\n    \"hits\": {\n        \"total\": 1,\n        \"max_score\": null,\n        \"hits\": [\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"covid-vax\",\n                \"_type\": \"patient\",\n                \"_id\": \"8a5c5f22-0e9b-4d64-b026-f606e70e544d\",\n                \"_score\": null,\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"VAERS_ID\": \"8a5c5f22-0e9b-4d","9756":"{\n\"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n        \"must\": [\n            {\n                \"term\": {\n                    \"date\": \"2021-06-10T00:00:00Z\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"term\": {\n                    \"symptom_text\": \"Sudden cardiac death\",\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n}\n\nQuestion 2: Give me all the patients who have a state of \"Alabama\" and had symptoms like \"Sudden Cardiac Death\".\n\nAnswer:\n{\n\"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n        \"should\": [\n            {\n                \"term\": {\n                    \"state\": \"Alabama\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"term\": {\n                    \"sympt","5798":"Give me all the patients whose information are received on 04\/13\/2022.

This will require you to build a pipeline to get the job done.\n\nYou can do this by first extracting the symptoms from the clinical notes using the NLP API. Next, you can create a list of all the symptoms. Then, you can use the text analytics API to count how many times each symptom occurs in a document. Finally, you can use the text analytics API to sort your results by frequency and return the top five most frequently occurring symptoms.\n\nSample:\nInput","7767":"Number of patients who received vaccines and had allergies to Naproxen\n\nWhat is the number of vaccine recipients that had an allergic to naproxin?\n\nNumber of patients who received vaccines and had allergies to Naproxen\n\nWhich is The most common generic for patients?\n\nWhich is the most common generic for vaccine recipients?\n\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder\nfrom nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer\nfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\nimport json\n\n# Load CSV file into","5086":"\"find number of patients who has been vaccinated and then their hemoglobin levels were tested within 90 days\"\n```","7499":"```elasticsearch\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"terms\": {\n                        \"allergies\": [\"amoxicillin trihydrate\"]\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Task 2: Clinical Notes\nPrompt: find the entity classification and label with following name:\n'RECVDATE','STATE','AGE_YRS','VAERS_ID','SEX','SYMPTOM_TEXT','DIED','ER_VISIT','L_THREAT','HOSPITAL','HOSPDAYS','DISABLE','VAX_DATE','LAB_DATA','OTHER_MEDS','CUR_ILL','HISTORY','PRIOR_VAX','TODAYS_DATE','OFC_VISIT','VAX_","7018":"The clinical notes table has the column name as 'Text'.

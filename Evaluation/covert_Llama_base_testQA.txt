Comment: Are you using a Python IDE such as PyCharm or VS Code? If so, can you share what it says when you hover over those variables to see if they are actually defined and not just ""undefined"" in your code?

Comment: @JosiahSimmons I am using VSCode. The variable values are defined in my code. I'm still new to coding but I understand how to use variables.

Comment: Can you show us a snippet of your code where you define `VAERS_ID` and `VAERS_STATE`? Also, I don't think that's a valid syntax for the `if` statement at the end, unless you meant to write `if (VAERS_ID == 2102142)` instead of `if VAERS_ID == 2102142`.

##### Solution 2 - Using `eval` function
This solution uses the `eval()` function to dynamically generate the query based on the input. This solution will work only if the conditions are boolean (either true or false). The `eval()` function executes a string as a Python expression.

This solution assumes that the data has been loaded into the ES database and the corresponding fields have been indexed properly.

```python
import pandas as pd
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch('https://www.elastic.co')

index = 'vaxsafe'

query = ""age_yrs < 5 AND died == True""

df = pd.DataFrame([['RECVDATE', '09/07/2021', 'STATE', 'VA', '"

Answer: The `recvdate` is a date field and you can use range filters to compare it.

#### Prompts

This is a multi-step question. First we need to find the interval between the vaccination date and onset date of each patient. Then, we need to count how many patients have an interval of 628.0 days.

#### Solution

First, we need to get the dates for the vaccination date and onset date for each patient. We can use the `get_dates` function in the `utils.py` file to do so. This function takes in two arguments: the `Elasticsearch` object and the list of patient IDs. It will return a dictionary that has two keys: ""vax"" (which is the vaccination date) and ""onset"" (which is the onset date).

Now that we have the dates for each patient, we can calculate the interval between the two dates using the `time_diff` function in the `"

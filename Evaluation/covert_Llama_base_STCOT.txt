Comment: I will be adding my code to my question now @Ajax1234

Comment: Your code is not related to the error message that you are showing here. The error message says `TypeError: Cannot read property'split' of undefined` which means that the object does not have a property named `'split'` which could mean that there is no element called `'split'` in the object or the object itself is undefined.

I am trying to do a SQL like search where I can input all of these fields that have values associated with them and I can filter by any of those values.  The output should be an integer representing the number of patients who received a vaccine injection matching my conditions.

Answer: You need to use a `where` clause in your sql query. To filter by multiple columns you can do something like:

\begin{code}
select count(*) as total_patients
from elasticsearch_database
where recvdate = '2014-10-01' and state = 'Florida' and sex ='male' and symtom_text = 'fever'

To generate the query, we can use a simple approach by using a while loop to iterate through all the fields and conditions, and then concatenating them together into a single string. However, this approach may not be very efficient since it involves iterating over all the fields and conditions multiple times.

We can improve the efficiency of the solution by creating a map that stores the field names and their corresponding values. This allows us to look up the field name and its corresponding value only once instead of iterating over all the fields and conditions multiple times.

I am working through this challenge, I have found some answers to questions in the past, but this one has stumped me so far. If anyone can point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated!

Comment: Can you share what code you've tried?

Comment: @john-harris - I don't really know where to start, I have been looking at the python3 script and trying to understand how that works as well as some of the other solutions posted by others, but nothing seems to stick when I try to write my own solution. I was thinking about writing a function called ""getQuery"" that takes in a list of conditions and returns a string, but I am not sure how to implement it or if that is the best way to go.

Comment: You should read up on the `if` statement. That's probably your best place to start."
11833,"\end{code}

Comment: I don't know anything about EMRs or medical records in general, but it seems like a pretty clear problem statement to me. Do you have any code that you tried? Where are you stuck?

Comment: This is just a small part of a much bigger project. The question here is to write a python program to generate the required SQL query. What I need help with is how can I identify the conditions based on the clinical notes and then translate those conditions into an SQL query.

Comment: So what do you think needs to happen to convert those conditions into an SQL query?

Comment: The main idea is to understand which fields are being compared in each condition. For example, the first condition has the field name [ ] and the comparison operator [ ]. This means we should check if the field named [ ] is equal to [ ]. Once we identify the fields, we should be able to generate the"

Comment: What are you trying to do?

Comment: I'm not sure what your question is. Please clarify your specific problem or add additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it’s hard to tell exactly what you're asking. See the [How to Ask](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) page for help clarifying this question.

Comment: The only thing I can think of is using `regex` to find the desired fields and then use them in a query, but I don't know how you would get the values from the regex into a query. Maybe someone else has an idea.

The code above works well but I don't know how to make it work as a function that takes two parameters:
1- field name

Comment: Welcome to Stack Overflow. Please read the help page about [how to ask a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

Comment: It sounds like you want to write a function to do this.

Comment: You can use `eval` but that might be dangerous...

Comment: @jasonharper, I thought about it but I couldn't find a way to achieve my goal.

\section{Explanation:}

The `bool` clause has two `must` clauses. The first must clause contains a term query on `SYMPTOM_TEXT` which looks for the text `""Rhesus Antibodies Negative""`.

The second must clause contains a term query on `VAERS_ID` which looks for the string `""1234567890""`.

The boolean query should return all documents containing both of these terms"

\begin{itemize}
\item The first task is to write a Python program that will take as input the field name and the condition value from the user.
\item Next, it should generate the query that can be used in elastic search to get the results.
\item It must also display the generated query.
\item Finally, it should show the result of the query on the terminal.

My code so far:

I have tried using the following code but I am not sure how to find the exact date from the list of dates.

es = Elasticsearch()

for hit in response[""hits""]:
    print (hit[""_source""])

Comment: You should probably use a filter instead of `bool` as it's more efficient. In any case, you can do something like `filtered = {""filtered"": {""filter"": {""range"": {""START_DATE"": {""gte"": ""2021-12-29""}}}}}`. Note that `start_date"

**Hints**:

* Use the following functions to parse the values in each line:
    * `split` - Splits a string into an array of substrings.

The patient ID is a unique identifier for each patient. 
Each note also includes information about when the symptoms began (onset date), how long they lasted (duration), and whether or not they resolved (resolved). 
We can use this data to answer questions like “How many patients had symptoms that lasted more than 1 week?” or “What percentage of patients experienced symptoms that lasted less than 3 weeks?” 
To answer these types of questions, we first need to understand how to extract data from the clinical notes. 
Then, we can use this extracted data to create a visualization that helps us better understand the relationship between symptom duration and resolution.

Comment: It would help if you showed some code that's not working. What have you tried?

Comment: @JohnGordon I have added my attempt at this problem. Any help is appreciated.

Answer: The `elasticsearch` package has a `query` function that takes a string in the format that you used in your example.

For instance, to get the same results as in your example, you can do something like:

\begin{code}
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from pyspark.sql.types import *
import pandas as pd
import requests
from pyspark.sql import Row

df = spark.read.json(""../input/data/vax_symptoms_2019-06-30_16.csv"")

df.show()

df.printSchema()"
4789,"```
SELECT * FROM ES_TABLE WHERE [SPECIFY THE FIELD NAME] = [SPECIFY THE CONDITION VALUE]
```

**Hints**
- The query language used in this problem is Elasticsearch. You can refer to the following link to learn more about it: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query.html
- The field name and condition value are separated by a semicolon (;).
- There will always be an equal sign (=) between the field name and the condition value.
- If there are multiple conditions, you need to separate them with AND. For example, you want to search for all patients whose age is over 20 years old and who have taken the test of sonogram. You need to generate the query as follows: ```SELECT * FROM ES_TABLE WHERE AGE"

Explanation:
The clinical note states to find all the patients who had a left shoulder mri test performed. Therefore, we have to search for records where the field ""STATE"" has the value ""left shoulder mri"". We can use the terms operator to search for multiple values in a single field. The range operator can be used to search for a numeric field. Here, we are searching for all records where the age is greater than or equal to 20 years old.

Comment: Please post a sample input, your code and the expected output.

Comment: I have edited my question. Thank you!

Comment: What are you trying to achieve? You seem to be mixing up programming languages here (Rust/Python) and tools (SQL/Elasticsearch). Are you sure you're not confusing them all together?

Comment: Yes, sorry about that. The clinical notes section should be in Python format, while the rest should be in SQL format. Basically, I am given a dataset, and then I need to find out the answer to a question given by the prompt. So if the question is ""Find the number of cases that the vaccine recipients had antenatal sonogram test."", I would need to generate the correct SQL statement so that"

Comment: Hi, I am not sure if I understand your question correctly, but from what I understood, you want to get all the patients that have taken ezetimibe? If so, then yes you can do that by selecting from `SELECT * FROM ELIGIBLE_PATIENTS WHERE PATIENT_DETAILS->""DRUG_LIST"" = 'ezetimibe'` (assuming there are no other ezetimibes in the list).

Comment: @KoenVerbeeck Yes, you got it correct! Thank you :)

**Solution 2**

This solution assumes that each patient record has a clinical notes section in which we can search for the keyword 'gabapentine'. We use a boolean query to combine two conditions:

5827,"Yes, 2 patients were taking estragon
```

The above example shows how to generate a query based on the field name and condition values. This is useful when you want to search for specific information in a database. For example, if you wanted to find all patients who are taking estrogen, you could use the following query:

```
$query = ""patient.sex == 'Female' AND patient.symptom_text == 'Estrogens'""
```
This would return all patients who are taking estrogen. You can also use this method to filter out certain types of data from your results. For example, if you only wanted to see patients who had been hospitalized within the last year, you could use the following query:

```
$query = ""patient.hospital == true AND patient.hospitaldays > 1""
```
This would return all patients who have been hospitalized"

7217,"Patients with ITP are usually given steroids to reduce the immune system's ability to destroy platelets. This often results in a remission of symptoms, but some patients may experience recurrent attacks. Treatment options include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), anti-D immunoglobulin, and splenectomy, which are all designed to reduce the body's immune response to platelet antigens. The IVIG is administered intravenously at high doses. Anti-D immunoglobulin is given intramuscularly and acts as an immunosuppressant. Splenectomy removes the spleen, reducing the risk of ITP recurrence by removing one of its primary sites of action. However, surgery carries risks and should only be considered after other treatments have failed or are unsuitable for the patient."

Comment: I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is not about programming.

Comment: @AshwinChacko You should be voting to reopen rather than closing a question that has already been answered. Also, questions like these are actually programming related and are on topic for Stack Overflow. The only difference between what you think is programming related and what you think isn't is whether or not it's a coding challenge. There is no reason why these types of questions shouldn't be on topic.

Comment: Please clarify your specific problem or provide additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it's hard to tell exactly what you're asking.

The output I got was

\begin{code}

I am confused why it didn't return the values of the other fields. What is wrong?

Comment: You are using `tokens` and `values`. So you are telling ES to search for the literal string `""pvc""` in the field. If that isn't there, then it will not match. Try `vax_name:""pvc""` or something like that"

842,"### This is a simple example of using ElasticSearch to generate queries. The first step is to define the search criteria in a structured format. In this case, we want to find all patients who are over 67.0 years old. We can use an array to represent this criteria, where each element contains a key-value pair that defines the search criteria. For example:

```
searchCriteria = {
    ""age"": {
        ""gt"": 67.0
    }
}
```
The next step is to create the query string that will be used to retrieve the desired results from ElasticSearch. This query string should be constructed based on the search criteria defined in the previous step. In this case, the query string would be something like:

```
""age gt 67.0""

Comment: Welcome to Stack Overflow! We encourage you to research your questions before asking them here. This is not a code writing service. I've removed the ""give me code"" portion of your post; it would be better if you edited it into something more like an actual question. See [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) for guidance on how to improve your posts.

Comment: You can also try to look at some existing code that does what you want (e.g. in some open source projects) and modify it until it works. This will give you experience working with Java.

Answer: If you are looking for the simplest solution, then just use the `elastic` library from spring data.

https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-elasticsearch

For example, you could search for any string which"

**Note:** The solution to a problem in a specific language may not work in other languages. For example, in Python, we are able to read a file as a list of strings, but in JavaScript, you have to use `FileReader` to achieve the same effect.

Comment: I think you should take a look at how `grep` works. You can use it to search through files for patterns. It also has options like `-i` which makes it case insensitive. So you could do something like `grep -i ""ebola"" myfile.txt` to find all instances of the word ebola in your file.

Comment: Are you asking how to use grep? Or are you asking how to write the code to generate the query?

Comment: @RyanCrawford The latter, I'm looking for advice on how to start approaching this problem.

Comment: I am not sure if you are using `Kibana` or `ElasticSearch`. If it is `kibana`, then you can use `scripted fields` to execute your code. https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.15/scripted-fields.html. Please do let me know if this helps.

Comment: @SanketShinde Thank you for your comment. I'm trying to write a program that will output a query string so that I can run it in Kibana. It looks like what you suggested would be useful for running the query, but not for creating it.

Comment: You can always create a scripted field (which runs your custom code) and display it in the visualization. You cannot directly call any external language from kibana.

Hint:
You can get all records that are older than a particular timestamp by adding an additional clause to your bool query:
```bash
{
""query"": {
    ""bool"": {
        ""must"": [
            {
                ""term"": {"
9664,"```python
query = {
    ""bool"": {
        ""must"": [
            {""range"": {""recvdate"": {""gt"": ""2022-02-23""}}}
        ],
        ""should"": [],
        ""minimum_should_match"": 1
    }
}
```

Comment: I'm sorry but this isn't a code writing service. What have you tried so far? Where did you get stuck? Please show your effort first.

Comment: This site isn't really for homework questions either. You need to put some work into it yourself before asking others to do it for you. That said, if you want to learn programming then you should start by learning a little bit of Python first. If you know nothing about Python then you can use Google or StackOverflow search to find information that will help you out.

Comment: @Riley1987 Thanks for your advice! I am new to python and just started a week ago. I am trying to solve this problem by going through all the lines in the file one by one. I have gotten to where I am able to output the answer for the first line, but not sure how to keep track of what I have done"

Both above examples are in single query. For this reason we can not use 'query_strategy' as nested.

**[1]** This is the first version of the clinical notes data analysis questions. It has three questions and a prompt for each question. For each question write down the relevant classification of entities and conditions along with a detailed explanation. Write out the ElasticSearch query that can be used to get answer. Also add a one line explanation for the logic behind the search query."

**Hint**: You can use the `elastic_query` function to build queries. 

The following are examples of using this function:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
from aws_cdk import core

app = core.App()
es = Elasticsearch(app, ""MyElasticsearch"")
es.create_domain(""example"", ""my-domain-id"", {
    ""settings"": {""index"": {""number_of_shards"": 1} }
})
```

For more information about this function, see the [ElasticsearchQuery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/aws_elasticsearch_query.html) section in the AWS"

Question: Given a patient's id, return a list of conditions (medication, vax, etc.) which were associated with that patient at some point in time
Answer:
```python

#### Part 4: Data Analysis (20 Points)

This part focuses on data analysis using python pandas and seaborn libraries.
You can access the data by running: `import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_csv('vaers_data.csv')`

For each of the below questions, use the python code to answer it and submit your code in a Jupyter Notebook in the submission. The link to the template notebook is available at the top of the page. Your solution must be written in Python, using the Pandas library. You are encouraged to learn more about Python from online resources such as"

##### Question 2

1. **ElasticSearch Database**

   * Query the database to find out if there are any records of deaths related to the Covid-19 vaccine.

   * Use a _match query_ to find the vaccine name that matches the exact name of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

   * If no record is found, use a _term query_ to search for the term “death” in the clinical notes column.

   * Export the data as JSON format.

	""query"":{
		""bool"":{""must"":[
			{""term"":{""fieldname"":""RECVDATE"",""value"":""2021-04-19""}}
		]}
	}
}
### Explanation:
The query must be true when both conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that the field named RECVDATE should have a value equal to 2021-04-19. Therefore, the query will look like this:
```
{
	""query"":{
		""bool"":{""must"":[
			{""term"":{""fieldname"":""RECVDATE"",""value"":""2021-04-19""}}"

### In the above code, what is the range operator? What does it do?

Answer: Range operators allow you to define a time interval for your search. It will return only results that match both ends of the range. The query in our case searches for documents where @timestamp falls between the specified date and time intervals.

            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:** The range filter used here will return all the documents that match the given date range (inclusive) of **@timestamp** field.

**Note:** This is a boolean query where we have one filter. There are other types of queries available in Elasticsearch like term query, bool query, nested query, function query etc.

### Write a query to"

### Condition1: Allergic to Penicillin
### Condition2: Patient was not vaccinated
### Condition3: Vaccination date is before 02/03/2022
### Condition4: Patient has received COVID-19 vaccine

### Based on the above condition list, create an elastic search query that will return only the records which satisfies all the above conditions.

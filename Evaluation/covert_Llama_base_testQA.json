First we need to find the interval between the vaccination date and onset date of each patient. Then, we need to count how many patients have an interval of 628.0 days.\n\n#### Solution\n\nFirst, we need to get the dates for the vaccination date and onset date for each patient. We can use the `get_dates` function in the `utils.py` file to do so. This function takes in two arguments: the `Elasticsearch` object and the list of patient IDs. It will return a dictionary that has two keys: \"vax\" (which is the vaccination date) and \"onset\" (which is the onset date).\n\nNow that we have the dates for each patient, we can calculate the interval between the two dates using the `time_diff` function in the `","7487":"```sql\nbool query = termQuery(\"allergies\", \"deletion\")\n```\n\n#### Q12\nQ12.

digestive disorder that results in a partial or complete loss of nutrients due to defects or problems in the gastrointestinal tract. Malabsorption may be caused by certain diseases, surgery, and dietary choices. It can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, bloating, cramping, diarrhea, and weight loss. The treatment for malabsorption depends on the underlying cause but typically includes changes to the diet, medications, and\/or surgery. Malabsorption can have serious consequences if left untreated, so it's important to seek medical advice if you experience any of the above-mentioned symptoms.]","5072":"###[ Find the number of cases that the vaccine recipients had left shoulder mri test. ]\nPrompt: \n### Elasticsearch database with field names:\n# RECVDATE, STATE, AGE_YRS, VAERS_ID, SEX, SYMPTOM_TEXT, DIED, ER_VISIT, L_THREAT, HOSPITAL, HOSPDAYS, DISABLE, VAX_DATE, LAB_DATA, OTHER_MEDS, CUR_ILL, HISTORY, PRIOR_VAX, TODAYS_DATE, OFC_VISIT, VAX_TYPE, VAX_MANU, VAX_LOT, VAX_DOSE_SERIES, VAX_NAME, ALLERGIES\n### What is the filed name?\n### What is the condition value for this field?","183":"```bash\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"range\": {\n                        \"@timestamp\": {\n                            \"gte\": \"2022-01-23T00:00:00Z\",\n                            \"lte\": \"2022-01-23T23:59:59Z\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"STATE\": \"received\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"should\": [\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"VAERS_ID\": \"47380000\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```","1835":"```\n{\n\t\"query\": {\n\t\t\"bool\": {\n\t\t\t\"filter\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"term\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"clinical_notes.keyword\": \"Myoglobin blood\"\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nClinical Notes: ###[ Give me all the patients who have Myoglobin blood after the vaccination and also had prior history of anaphylaxis. ]\nAnswer:\n```\n{\n\t\"query\": {\n\t\t\"bool\": {\n\t\t\t\"filter\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"term\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"clinical_notes.keyword\": \"Myoglobin blood\"","1820":"```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": [\n                {\n                    \"terms\": {\n                        \"VAERS_ID\": [\n                            6934750,\n                            1882885,\n                            6189643\n                        ]\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"STATE\": \"NY\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"should\": [\n                {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"STAGES\": \"prostatic\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"filter\": {\n                \"range\": {\n                    \"VAERS_ID\": {\n                        \"gt\": \"6934750\",\n                        \"lt\": \"188","12653":"| [vax_name] | [age_yrs] | [recvd_date] | [state] | [hospital_days] | [prior_vax] | [hist_inj_symptoms] | [ofc_visit] | [lab_data] | [cytomegalovirus_test_negative] | [cur_ill] | [other_meds] | [vaers_id] | [sex] | [symptom_text] | [died] | [er_visit] | [l_threat] | [hosp_da] | [disab] | [todays_date] | [received_date] | [prior_vax_date] | [lab_data] | [other_meds] | [cur_ill] | [history] | [hist_inj_sym","5056":"```bash\n{\n\"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n        \"must\": [\n            {\n                \"terms\": {\n                    \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\": [\n                        \"Excision Test\"\n                    ]\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n}\n```\n\nClinical Notes: ###[ Find the number of cases that the vaccine recipients had symptom text \"headache\".]\nAnswer:\n```bash\n{\n\"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n        \"must\": [\n            {\n                \"term\": {\n                    \"SYMPTOM_TEXT\": \"headache\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n}\n```\n\nClinical Notes: ###[ Find the number of cases that the vaccine recipients had symptom text \"headache\"","11438":"# Pipeline\n\n- Input:\n    -
